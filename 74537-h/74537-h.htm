“Well, Frank, how do you get on with your
hoeing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two acres! I don’t believe the land’s
measured right, anyhow,” said the boy,
“and—father, the circus is coming to-day.”
Frank stood leaning on his hoe and looking
up into his father’s face with that
entreaty in his eyes which every loving
parent knows so well.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry, Frank, but you remember our agreement,”
said his father very seriously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t know the lot was so <i>awful</i> long and wide.
I’m tired of it, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, my boy. I will take the field back and
call the men to finish hoeing the corn, if you say so;
if you are willing to give it up now, when it has come
to the hoeing, and that half done, count the cost,
Frank; count it well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to go to the circus,” said the boy, looking
ruefully over the long rows of corn that yet remained
to be hilled.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>“Very well. I am off to the city now. If you conclude
to give it up, you can tell John, and call him to
finish the hoeing, while you go to the circus; but,
Frank, take my advice, and think well before you
decide.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hallock went across the field to the place where
Neptune, Kate’s pony, waited to take him to the
railway station.</p>

<p class='c009'>The house at Hallock Point overlooked the sea and
a large portion of the farm. From an upper window
in the house Kate Hallock, Frank’s twin sister,
watched her father as he left Neptune under the hedge
and crossed the field to speak to her brother. Frank
and Kate were thirteen years old, and the youngest
children of the family. Kate was devoted to Frank.
The minute Mr. Hallock turned to leave the cornfield,
she started to learn the result of the interview. By
the time she reached Frank she was quite out of
breath, for she had made haste as fast as she could,
and the dust of the furrows had covered her shoes,
and the careless child had left her hat in the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank!” she cried, “did he say you might go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, Kate Hallock, what is the use of
frightening a year’s growth out of a fellow in that
way? I’ve a great mind not to tell you a word he
said,” exclaimed the lad, turning suddenly to meet the
anxious, expectant face that he was obliged to look
down upon to see: for Frank was much taller than
Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank, I didn’t mean to start you so; but you
know I can’t make a noise walking in this soft ground.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>I’ll borrow the dinner-horn next time I come out to
see you, and toot it all the way. Please tell me what
he said.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“See here, Kate, couldn’t you do a kind turn for
me? Why didn’t you fetch your hat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind my hat. I’ll do anything to help you,
if you can only go to the circus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you count the rows I’ve got to do between
here and the fence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate disappeared behind Frank’s back, and he hoed
away as fast as ever he could, until she returned and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, there’s twenty-seven rows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never can do it in the world! There’s ninety-three
hills in every single row.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t it be nice to help you pick the corn! Papa
won’t call <i>that</i> having help about it, I know. O I wish
it was time for harvest! Won’t it be just nice to have
piles and piles of great ears, all your own! You’ll be
most rich, won’t you, Frank?” cried Kate, joyously
clapping her hands before the imaginary heaps of corn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See here, Kate, if I keep the corn I’ve got to stay
here and keep on hoeing it all day and half of to-morrow,
at least.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did papa say so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said I must keep my engagement with him,
or give up the field and call John in to finish it. You
know, Kate, it ought to have got hoed more’n a week
ago, only I went fishing and everything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know, Frank, there’s always something
happening to take us off, and to-morrow’s the picnic.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>“So ’tis, and there’ll be a jolly good time; but
there’s picnics every little while, and it’s awful dull
work hoeing corn. Just see these weeds—stubborn,
horrid things!” and the boy struck at them with a
force that cut the corn off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank, there’ll be a hole here now all Summer?”
and Kate stooped and gathered up the broad leaves
that had fallen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t mean to do it, Kate. See here, if you
really mean to help me—there’s Hugo, the new hand;
he don’t know anything about it, and you just tell
him to fetch his hoe up this way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank, you don’t mean <i>that</i>!” with a throb in
her throat that Frank tried to forget that he had
heard. “Just think how mean that would be, when
you promised to do every bit of the work your own
self. Don’t cheat, Frank, <i>don’t</i>! I did <i>once</i>, and I
feel awfully shrivelled up every time I think of it;
and I always do think of it when it thunders or the
wind blows hard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>You</i>, Kate? Tell me what you cheated about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Frank,” quite solemnly; “it wasn’t <i>you</i> that
I deceived.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not—your own brother. If you had, I
should have been sure to find you out. So you won’t
tell Hugo to come here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I’ll call Hugo, if you ask me to, when I get
my bonnet on. The sun burns—my head aches now;
but, Frank, you <i>won’t</i> let Hugo hoe the corn,” she
said beseechingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I guess you needn’t send him. Hark! what’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>that music? O, it’s the circus coming up the road!
Let’s run and see the big chariot and the cages go by.
Here, take my hat!” he shouted, tossing his straw hat
back, and rushing through the corn in the direction of
the highway.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate put the hat on and followed after. A high
stone wall enclosed that portion of Hallock Point.
Beyond the wall there was a row of old, wind-twisted,
gnarled, wild-cherry trees. When Kate came to the
wall, the music was quite near. She could see the
nodding plumes on “something or other—she didn’t
know what”; but over the wall she could not climb.
She shouted to Frank to come and help her—for the
wall was higher than her head; and Frank called back
to her that he was up in the cherry tree, and ’twas
just splendid. “There are three elephants and camels,
and, O, Kate, there are some real live Indians!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For one brief second Kate was glad that the wall
was between her and the real live Indians; but the
music came near and nearer, and the huge chariot—“such
as no kings of the East ever dreamed of riding
in,” Frank afterward told her—rolled along, bearing
aloft gaily-dressed men and women. Kate could see
them, and she saw the heads and backs of the
elephants and the camels, and the tops of many cages,
and at the very last, a forlorn looking boy’s face—just
a glimpse of it, as she gave a jump high up to catch
sight of anything more that might be coming. The
boy was seated on a pony, but that Kate could not see.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are they all gone, Frank?” she called.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I see the red of the big elephant’s blanket
between the trees, and that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>“Come then!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just give me my hat—you sit down and wait; I’ll
be back in no time at all; I’m going to run across lots,
up to the mound, to see it come down on the other
side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, please let me see it with you. Help me
over the wall. I can run as fast as you can when I
once get over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’ll be gone before I can get there, and you can
see it all this afternoon. Toss over my hat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was well shaded where Frank stood, under the
cherry trees, but on the other side the sun poured
down its heat on poor Kate’s head, as she took off the
straw hat and threw it over to Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was too warm to wait there, and Frank’s cornfield
lay between the wall and any place that was shaded.
In crossing the lot Kate came upon the small-sized hoe
that her brother had thrown down in his flight. She
picked it up, and putting the handle into the soft earth,
left it standing there, that her brother might easily
find his place again. Then she did her very best to
twist her apron around her head, and went home.
She did not know how long she had been gone.
There was Neptune waiting at the carriage gate to
carry her to school, and in the doorway stood her
mother, saying as the girl drew near,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Kate, where have you been?—without a hat,
too, in this sun.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, mamma!” cried the child, “if you only knew
how much poor Frank wants to go to the circus this
afternoon; I’ve been up by the wall looking at the
procession go by.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“Hush, Kate; your father is only just. Frank
wanted to earn money for himself like other boys, and
do you think if he were working for any farmer that
that farmer would let his corn spoil, as Frank is letting
his, running off day after day? No. If he goes away
again until the last hill is hoed, your father will take
it away from him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Kate glanced back toward the field. She
knew just where the hoe stood, gleaming in the sunshine,
a witness that her brother was at that very
moment neglecting his work. She hastened to her
own room, washed her burning face, and then went to
school in the village.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was on the mound in time to see the “great
show” go past. On the pony in the rear, looking
neither at the swaying figures in the chariot, nor at the
long line of cages that followed after, was the boy
with the sadness in his eyes. A bobolink, thoughtless
fellow, struck up a song of gladness as he wavered
through the air from tree to tree. Frank, listening
to the band of music, did not hear the delight of the
bird, but the boy on the pony did. He wiped his eyes
with his jacket sleeve two or three times, and wiped
them yet again. Frank had drawn close to the roadside.
He was near enough to the lad to speak to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you belong to the circus?” he ventured to ask.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wash the dishes, when I don’t ride this pony.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Circus dishes!” exclaimed Frank, “that’s funny.”
And the desire to learn something more led him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>walk along. He could easily keep step with the
progress of the chariot and elephants.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently he asked, “Do you like it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve nothing else to do,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s your name? Mine is Frank Hallock, and
I live in the house up yonder,” pointing, with a feeling
very like pride, to the distant gables and chimneys
that represented his home.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My name’s Harry Cornwall,” replied the boy,
glancing toward the place Frank had pointed out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s the circus going to be?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got most there,” said the boy, “and I’m
glad of it, for I want my breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No breakfast yet? Why it must be nine o’clock.
Come home with me and I’ll give you some right off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, I can’t. I told you I had the dishes to wash,
and there’ll be an awful hurry to-day, for it rained in
the night, and we’re late.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I could see you do it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing’s easier, if you come on and follow me.
The first tent that goes up will be for the breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be most as good as the circus, its own self,”
thought Frank, and forgetting Kate, his hoe, and his
corn, he followed on, until the long procession came to
the ground where the great display of animals and
human dexterity was to be made.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t it jolly?” he cried, as he watched the hurried
movements of the men pitching the great tent and
the side tents, rolling the cages to their appointed
places, picketing the elephants and the camels, and
leading off the tired horses to be fed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“Maybe it looks so, youngster, but it’s the hardest
work I ever tried. I’d rather hoe corn all day,”
responded a busy man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me! I wonder if he knows,” thought Frank,
and in just one moment more he meant to hurry back
to his duty, but there was the immense coffee-pot
boiling away on the stove, and it looked so funny, the
breakfast that was being prepared under the tent, and
he had never seen the wild beasts fed before; he was
very curious to learn what the camels and the kangaroos
had to eat, and “O, ’twas just splendid,” Frank
thought—“a great deal better than going to a real
circus, this getting ready for one.” Before the
camels had taken in all the water they wanted, there
was the call to breakfast, and there were the wild
Indians, snatching off their long jute hair, throwing
aside their painted faces, and coming out of beaded
blankets and tinselled bands, nothing but tawny white
men after all, and sitting down to breakfast in the
tent. How hungry they were! “They eat like
savages, anyway,” whispered Frank to Harry Cornwall,
“use their knives for forks, and, dear me, they
are not a bit polite.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They don’t know any better,” responded Harry.
“I don’t believe they—some of them—ever saw a nice
table like you have at home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you?” questioned Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My mother was a lady,” said the boy, again wiping
his eyes with his jacket sleeve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me! Take my handkerchief,” said Frank,
drawing one from his pocket, but instantly concealing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>it, for he had forgotten that he had wiped his hands
with it when running from the cornfield.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry laughed, and thanked him, and then ran to
refill the coffee-bowls about the table. By the time
he had filled the last one and returned to the stove
just outside the tent, the men began to leave the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, if you want to see the circus dishes, come
on,” called Harry, “and if you’ll help wipe, then we’ll
have a chance to see Bengalee.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s Bengalee?” asked Frank—“another sham
Indian?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed. It’s real blood this time; true Indian,
too. The tiger is getting rampacious, and they’re
going to fix him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While Harry gave the information, he was gathering
together knives, forks, spoons, bowls, and plates,
as handy as any woman—and, in his eagerness to see
the tiger, Frank was gathering up dishes before he
knew what he was about.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s clever in you,” said Harry. “If I had
somebody to <i>like</i> around here, ’twouldn’t seem so bad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like it first-rate—a great deal better than
staying at home and hoeing corn,” thought Frank,
and presently, while Harry plunged the dishes into
hot water, Frank found himself telling the story of
the cornfield that his father had given him. Before
the last dish was wiped, Harry had told Frank how he
came to belong to the circus. In listening to Harry’s
account of his escape from the great fire that swept
over Michigan a few years ago, both children forgot
all about the tiger in his cage, and when Harry came,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>in his story, to the place where he lost all his family,
he wiped his eyes with the dishcloth many times before
he could go on to the place where he had found the
circus encamped, and somebody to give him food and
clothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heigh ho!” exclaimed Frank, “what a hero you
are! I wish my Kate could see you. Nothing ever
happens to me. It’s go to bed every night in the same
bed, and get up every morning in the same room, and
see just the same things and folks over and over again.
Stupid, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d go and go, and walk and climb and run, years
and years, to see the same old faces and have the same
old home again!” said Harry, choking and sobbing to
a degree that quite upset Frank Hallock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You just come home with me, then, and see my
father and mother,” said Frank, not knowing how to
suggest comfort in any other form.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They wouldn’t let me,” sobbed Harry, quite
broken down by a touch of sympathy. “Nice folks
don’t like circus folks at all; you know they don’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see why, when ministers’ children and
deacons’ children, and everybody’s boys and girls, go
to the circus,” replied Frank; and then feeling that
he had not touched the heart of the trouble, he plunged
into it by saying, “Look here, you Harry Cornwall,
you are not circus folks at all; you are only a boy
out of the Michigan fires. Why, my mother sent off
lots of clothes to Grand Haven and Port Huron, and
other places out there; and my sister Kate tucked into
one of the boxes her new gold necklace that Grandma
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Thornton had just sent her for her birthday, without
anybody’s finding it out until the box had been gone
pretty nigh a month. Come home with me, I say;
everybody will be glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, I can’t,” ejaculated Harry, having conquered
his sobs during the time of Frank’s long speech; “I’ve
got to ride Flurry this afternoon and evening. Flurry
is the pony I was on this morning, and in the night,
some time, we break up and travel on, maybe for half
the night. Hark! they are taming the tiger now.
Hear the poor fellow mew!”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Frank heard the roar of poor “Bengalee” in
his cage, he was so terrified that he began to run as
fast as he could, and he did not stop to look around
until he reached the top of the hill, well nigh a quarter
of a mile from the white tents.</p>

<p class='c009'>His heart was beating so fast that he could scarcely
count the strokes of the bell in the church tower. It
was striking for twelve of the clock. A feeling of
dismay came upon the lad as he counted out the
number of twelve. He had been away from his duty
three hours. In one hour dinner would be ready.
Kate would be home from school. Poor Kate!
Frank’s face grew warm and warmer with a wholesome
shame under the vivid recollection of the manner
in which, and the place where, he had left her to wait
in the burning sun for his return.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he went onward in the direction of his home,
he looked frequently at the windows, half expecting
to see his mother looking out. But no; she was
occupied within doors, and not one of the household
knew that Frank had neglected his duty.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“I don’t care, anyway,” he thought, and he went
on thinking after this fashion. “It isn’t at all the kind
of weather to be cooped up hoeing corn. I’d rather
earn money some easier way. It’s jolly to be a circusboy,
I know. I wonder why Harry Cornwall doesn’t
like it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, Frank took his hoe from the place
where Kate had left it for him, and fell to work,
resolved to hoe “like anything” until it should be
time for dinner.</p>

Harry Cornwall ran out from the
tent to watch the flight of Frank Hallock,
who ran, frightened by the tiger, and as
the boy disappeared from sight over the
hilltop, Harry determined to try and find
time enough that very evening to run up to
the big house and tell all he knew about the
necklace that somebody had tucked into
the pocket of the waistcoat that fell to
Jack Flibbit after the great fire. Harry could not persuade
himself that two little girls in the land had put
two necklaces, with the same mark, into pockets to go
“Out West.” Harry’s name was called in a loud
tone, and he ran to obey the call at about the same
moment that Frank Hallock reached the cornfield and
picked up his hoe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank counted the hills and the rows, and scarcely
looked up until the sound of the one o’clock train, on
the New Haven Railroad, passing through the town,
told to him how short the hour had been.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Neptune came home. Frank knew that Kate
was on the carriage-road that ran past the field, but
he would not look up, not even when he heard her
cheery call to him; so Neptune and Kate went on
their way, and presently the welcome sound of the
dinner-horn was heard.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Frank did not throw down his hoe, but fell to work
harder than ever. In five minutes’ time the horn was
sounded again, and on looking up, Frank beheld Kate
standing on the veranda—she was waving her hat to
attract his attention. He was inclined to make a
martyr of himself just then, so he waved his straw hat
in return, and immediately resolved to “hoe away
like a major.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In fifteen minutes more Kate was making her way
for the second time that day through Frank’s cornfield.
As she drew near, she called out, “Frank!
Frank! why in the world don’t you come to dinner?
There is a gentleman at table who came to see papa
on business, and I ran away after the soup—I
couldn’t eat my dinner one bit, without you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll <i>have</i> to, I reckon,” returned Frank; “a
poor fellow, like me, who has to hoe corn all day, can’t
stop to eat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank Hallock! <i>for shame!</i>” cried Kate,
putting down her indignant foot without being able
to make noise enough about it to disturb an earthworm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s <i>true</i>,” responded Frank, pitching into the
next hill with all his might.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is <i>not</i> true,” cried Kate; “and if just running
off to <i>look</i> at the circus pass by makes you say such
things, I am glad you can’t go to see it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of <i>course</i> you are. I <i>knew</i> you was, the whole
time! It’s just like a girl. Girls always have the best
times, and its pretty easy work for them. Nobody
ever sends <i>you</i> off on errands in the sun and the cold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and storms, and no one ever tells <i>you</i> not to sit on the
nice chairs and things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Frank!” began Kate, who was not at all
inclined to argue with him, “if you will not come in
and get your dinner, you may go without it. I
must go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank did not look up from his work, and Kate
turned away and left him, feeling that he deserved
to go without his dinner. Before she reached the
house she began to feel very sorry for him, and by
the time dinner was over she was ready to cry, with
mingled pity and vexation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor fellow! he must be so hungry,” she thought,
“and he has been hard at work in the hot sun so long.
I’ll just go and carry him some dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Taking her dinner-basket she packed it quite full,
and for the third time that day Kate trudged away
to that absent brother of hers in the cornfield.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t stop to eat!” called Frank the instant he
perceived what Kate carried. “I’ve got to work right
on, night and day, till this is done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank! do put that hoe down and eat this
dinner! See how nice it is! Salmon, strawberries, and
things! You never saw such nice strawberries in your
life, I know. I saved half of mine for you, I knew
you liked them so much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Holding forth the luscious berries, Kate pleaded
with Frank thus:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Frank, please, won’t you eat them? Just
the berries, if nothing more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t, Kate; ’twould take time.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“You provoking fellow! I’ve a great mind to eat
them myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do! I know you want them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate’s eyes filled with tears. She stood silently
during the time that Frank hoed four hills of corn.
Then putting the basket down, and taking the dish of
berries with its spoon, she followed down the furrow
until she came to Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See!” she said, hiding her dim eyes behind an
eager little laugh, “you hoe away, and I will feed
you—a spoonful of berries at every hill. Take one
now,” holding up her short white arm so that the
spoon just touched his dusty lips. Frank caught back
his face from contact with the berries. He was determined
to be a martyr, and that Kate should have her
pleasure marred by pity for him; and yet Frank <i>was</i>
very hungry. He wanted his dinner as only a healthy,
hungry boy can want it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, won’t you eat these just to please me?” she
said, finally.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t, Kate. You don’t appreciate a fellow’s
situation, or you wouldn’t ask me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I s’pose,” ejaculated Kate, “you appreciate <i>mine</i>
in bringing you your dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do, Kate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then eat it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” rather faintly, as he caught sight of the
tempting salmon, for Kate had taken up the basket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye, then. I’m going.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye. I hope you’ll have a good time at the
circus.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“I sha’n’t, I know; thinking of you here will make
me very happy, won’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It ought to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate stood irresolute for a moment, then she went
away, leaving Frank’s dinner on the ground. He saw
her put the basket down and poise the dish of berries
on its top. He kept along the row he was hoeing until
he reached the stone wall; then, instead of following
it back, his hungry desire for the contents of the
basket overcame his desire for martyrdom, and he
went back, hoe in hand, to the place where Kate had
left it, but no basket could he find.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate, growing more and more indignant at her
brother’s ingratitude, as she went on her way toward
the house, had yielded to the sudden temptation to
return and pick it up. Frank had not looked around
once, and thus had not seen Kate, nor heard her
exclaim as she gathered it in her hands, “The bad,
naughty boy <i>shall</i> not have it at all.” And the “bad,
naughty boy” did not get it at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Kate, warm and panting from the haste she had
made, reached the end of the field and was going by
a bit of hedge, she saw a man sitting on the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked to Kate very hungry. At all events she
knew he must be very tired, for he was leaning his
head against a tree trunk and was fanning himself
with a straw hat. His eyes were closed, and as Kate
moved along without making much noise, he did not
hear a sound until she spoke to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matter with you? Are you sick?” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>questioned. She might quite as well have asked him
if he was the man in the moon, for he did not comprehend
one word of English. He reached forth his
hands for the food she carried, doubtless thinking
that Kate was the good angel who had been sent in
answer to his great need.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man had been very ill in a hospital at New
Haven. As soon as he could walk a little, he had
made his escape, without having strength enough to
reach the place where he wished to be. Having seen
Mr. Hallock’s house, he hoped to gain it before sitting
down to rest, but had not been able to get there.</p>

<p class='c009'>He devoured Frank’s dinner with such eagerness
that Kate began to wonder whether or not he would
leave the fork and spoon. She felt quite happy when
at last he returned them to the basket, and asked,
by signs, if he should carry it to the house for her.
She shook her head, and took it from him. After
going on a few steps, she turned to look at the man,
and her kind heart-of-pity was touched by his sorrow,
although she knew nothing of his sad story. Remembering
that she had the money in her pocket that her
father had given to her that she might go to the circus,
she suddenly resolved that she would give it to him,
and stay home. “I should not enjoy anything, thinking
of poor Frank, anyway,” she thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man had apparently fallen asleep when Kate
returned. Her feet made no sound on the turf as she
stole back to the spot. His head was against the tree
at whose foot he sat; his hat lay upon the ground.
Kate dropped the bit of paper currency into it, and
went noiselessly away.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Dear Kate Hallock never knew what she did that
day. The fifty cents that she gave enabled the poor
fellow to be in time to find his sister, who, alone in a
land that was new and strange to her, had lost her
brother. No wonder that he had made his escape
from the hospital, and was trying to get back to the
place where he had left her. He was just in time:
for she was about to start with a band of strangers
for the “Great West,” not knowing what else to do;
and she had with her all the money that the brother
possessed.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is so sweet to drop little acts of kindness as we
pass along our daily round. They may fall seemingly
into the ground, but God knows that not one of them
ever fails to do its own bright work somewhere for
some one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate Hallock went home with the empty basket,
wondering what she should do with herself all the
June afternoon. She thought that she would go past
the field where Frank was at work and on down the
lane leading to the sea. It would be nice and cool
down there, and maybe she could dig some clams with
her own hands, just enough for Frank’s supper.
Kate was quite certain that he would be hungry, so
hungry that he would have to eat, by tea time.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she went to find her mother, that lady was
engaged in conversation with the strange gentleman.
Kate overheard him say, “You must be extremely
sorry to part with this place,” and she did not hear
her mother’s reply.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“Part with this place?” thought Kate. “How
funny that sounded! What did he mean, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Kate soon forgot all about it, for the Glenns
came for her to go to the circus with them. There
were Mr. Glenn, Florence, Will, and Stacey. In vain
Kate pleaded that she had used her money for something
else. She was carried off in spite of herself, and
so lost her pleasant time down by the sea. She went
with tears close to her eyes and many a dim look back
at the figure of her brother, toiling away in the field.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Hallock also watched her boy with many misgivings.
She knew the history of Kate’s endeavor,
and quite approved of the disposition she had made of
the contents of the basket.</p>

<p class='c009'>Four of the clock came. The strange gentleman had
taken his departure for that day. Frank had borne
his martyrdom long enough. He could endure the
terrible gnawing in his stomach no longer; so he
dropped his hoe, and made his way to the house and
the kitchen, and asked the cook for “something
to eat.” “I’ll have it right here on your table,” he
said; “some bread and milk, if you’ve nothing more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank’s manner and whole appearance was so
wonderfully subdued, that the cook was impressed by
it to bring forth her best stores for the tired boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter, Master Frank? What ails you,
that you can’t eat a single morsel?” she cried: for
Frank sat before the little dinner, and did not touch it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” said Frank; “I—I—can’t <i>half see</i>
it!” and rising up, poor Frank tried to get from the
kitchen to his mother.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The cook followed him, calling out “Mrs. Hallock!
Mrs. Hallock! please make haste! It’s Frank!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Hallock met the boy in the hall. He staggered
up to her, crying out “I’m so sick! <i>so sick!</i> My head!
my head!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Hallock sat beside Frank, bathing his head,
and trying her utmost to help him bear the pain and
deadly feeling “a sick-headache” brings with it.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the performance at the circus, the lad,
Harry Cornwall, in attempting a difficult feat in
riding, fell from his pony.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sad-faced boy had been recognized by Kate
Hallock. The instant he appeared, Kate was interested.
She watched each movement he made, and
when she saw him fall, she covered her face and
uttered a cry of horror. The lad was gathered up by
two men. They disappeared with him from the scene,
and the performance went on.</p>

<p class='c009'>After that, Kate could not bear to stay one moment
longer. She was wondering where they had carried
the hurt boy, and what they were doing for him, and
whether or not he had a father, or a brother, there to
take thought for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>This new trouble, added to the vision of Frank at
work in the field without any dinner, quite overcame
Kate. She asked to go home so earnestly, that Mr.
Glenn accompanied her outside of the tent, and then
Kate went home alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush-sh-sh-sh!” was the first whispered sound
that she heard at the entrance door of her home.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Master Frank’s took awful sick!” said Bridget,
“and your mother’s with him, upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Kate flew up the stairway, so sorry that she had run
back and picked up the basket. She stole into the
room, and for a moment could not see any one within
it, it had been so carefully darkened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quiet, Kate!” said Mrs. Hallock. “Frank has
been working in the sun so long without eating anything,
that he has an attack of sick-headache, but he
is getting better now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kate, won’t you fetch a fellow a crust of bread?”
asked Frank, throwing the napkin from his forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I will, Frank. Don’t you want a piece
of toast?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! Bring me what I want—a crust—the
brownest one you can find.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Away ran Kate to fulfil his wish, and presently,
having returned with it and watched its disappearance
from sight, she said: “Something awful happened at
the circus this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What? Did the tiger mew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ridiculous fellow,” she cried. “A boy fell
from the pony he was riding, and I guess he was
awfully hurt, too, for some men sprang in and carried
him off, and—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What boy, pray?” asked Frank, taking his head
from the pillow and leaning it on his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do I know?” cried Kate; “but don’t you
remember the little fellow who was clear behind everything
this morning?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It <i>wasn’t</i> him, I hope, Kate,” with a catch in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>breath that made Mrs. Hallock tell him to “lie down
and keep still.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes it was, that very boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother,” spoke up Frank, “that poor fellow hasn’t
a friend left in the world. Everybody belonging to
him was burned up in the big fire in Michigan, you
know. The circus, <i>this</i> circus, was going about
through the state, and this boy was trying to get somewhere
where he could live, when he found it, and has
been going about with it ever since.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank had counted the cost before he had spoken.
He knew just what it involved to tell the whole truth,
but he came out with it bravely, telling the story of the
morning spent on the circus grounds, and what he had
there learned from Harry Cornwall about himself.
“Mother,” he said at the end of his statement, “they
take up their tents and go away in the night. Won’t
you please send Richard to find out if he is much
hurt?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s just good and sweet and beautiful and everything
in you, dear Frank,” said Kate, the instant her
mother had gone to send Richard according to the
boy’s request, adding, “I’ll forgive you everything
naughty you may do all summer, for this, and I’ll love
you always, <i>dearly</i>, Frank!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course you will, Kate. You couldn’t help it, if
you tried!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, you’ll have to give up the corn now,” said
Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know it. What of it?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“Aren’t you awful sorry?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe I am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you <i>will</i>, you know. Father said it,” added
Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You needn’t keep saying it over to a fellow, to
make it worse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t; but I thought <i>you</i> thought papa would let
you have it yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No such thing. I know better! <i>I</i> wouldn’t if I
were in his place. I’d just stick to what I said and I
wouldn’t budge an inch,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Mrs. Hallock entered the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you send him, mother?” questioned Kate,
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and I sent the carriage, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Both children asked what for. Kate with eager,
glistening eyes, and Frank, because he didn’t know
what else to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I gave Richard orders to fetch him home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate clapped her hands softly, kissed her mother
half a dozen times, and then ran upstairs to the room
adjoining Frank’s own, to see with her own eyes that
Bridget made it properly ready for the coming boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank and Kate were greatly disappointed when
Richard came back with the carriage. The doctor
would not permit Harry Cornwall to be moved.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning Frank was up “bright and early,”
and for two hours before it was time for breakfast he
worked away with right good will in the field, hoeing
corn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor fellow!” said Mrs. Hallock, looking out from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>her dressing-room upon the boy, “I’m afraid Frank
thinks that if he works very hard, and finishes the
work this week, that you will relent and let him have
the corn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Mr. Hallock; “he can’t think that. He
knows better. But it is hard to take away all that he
has done; for Frank <i>has</i> worked well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The best thing that he has done is the telling the
truth,” said Frank’s mother, with glistening eyes. “It
would have been very easy for Frank to have kept
still, and then we need not have known where he spent
the morning. I think he ought to know how thankful
we feel for his manliness. We must prove it to him
in some way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after the above conversation, the family met
in the breakfast-room. Frank entered bright and
glowing, and with a face as happy as though he owned
a hundred acres of growing corn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good morning, Frank. How is <i>my corn</i> this
morning? You know it is mine now,” said Mr.
Hallock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes sir,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, papa, papa!” entreated Kate, “when Frank has
been so good and everything!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, you beseeching puss!” said her father, “you
wish me to give it to you, I dare say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir—<i>do</i>; and I’ll give it to Frank right off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you; but Frank would not take it,” said
the lad. “Papa’s bargain was square and fair, and I’m
bound to stand by it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What made you go and hoe, then, before breakfast?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>cried Kate, looking blissfully proud of her
bright-faced brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I thought I would,” responded Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank,” spoke up Mr. Hallock, “what would you
do, were you in my place, with that cornfield?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me? I? O, I would give it to the hurt circusboy,
Harry Cornwall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is Harry Cornwall’s,” said Mr. Hallock.</p>

<p class='c009'>After breakfast something happened.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The house to which Harry Cornwall was
carried after he had been thrown from his
pony was in Pumpkin Delight Lane. You
will perhaps think that this name is not a
“real true” name of a “real true” lane,
but it is, and it will lead you through many
a wild, solitary place, past farm lots and
salt meadows, down at last to Peconick
Point; but Grandma Dobson lived at the
upper end of it, nearly to the village. Her house was
one of the oldest in the town. It was the loveliest
brown in color, because no man’s paint had touched it.
The modern improvements had not marched down
Pumpkin Delight Lane, and I am sorely afraid that,
had they, dear Grandma Dobson would have shut her
door against them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Grandma Dobson was grandma to the children
thereabout, although she had no grandchildren of her
own. Long years ago, thirty—nearly forty—she was a
bright young maiden, and Charlie Dobson was a brave
sailor lad. He was going on a long voyage, and he
was going as ship’s master for the first time. His
ship was ready to sail. So, one day they were
married, and the young captain went to sea without
his bride, because he did not wish to risk her life in
the <i>Snow</i>. <i>Snow</i> was the name of his ship. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>next voyage he was to have a new ship, and then her
home should be on it. She went down to the harbor
to bid him farewell. The <i>Snow</i> lifted her sails and
sailed away—no man knew whither, and no man
knoweth to-day, for the ship never was heard from
any more.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little wife lived in the old farm home, waiting,
waiting—many, many years. There was one window,
high up in the garret, close to the roof, where she used
to sit and sew from morning until night, and wear her
poor eyes dim with looking out, past a little island that
lay just outside, for the <i>Snow</i> to come sailing into the
bay. She was a dressmaker. If the dresses she
made, sitting up there, could tell the story of the hopes
and fears that went out and in with the stitches and
the tides, how sweet, and sad, and hopeless, the history.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the men, looking out for the nearest house to
take Harry Cornwall into, after his fall from the pony,
espied Grandma Dobson’s habitation, that dear old
soul was at that window looking out over the bar, past
the island, away across the miles of sea, thinking it
just possible—at least she would look once more, it
could do no harm, for the <i>Snow</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>She saw the men bearing a burden. Some one was
drowned, perhaps. She went down to see, and met
them at the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me! what’s happened?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A boy is hurt. May we bring him in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The poor lad! Yes, indeed. Lay him right here!
He isn’t dead, is he?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She opened the window to let in the breeze coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>up from the sea; and they laid Harry down, sawdust
and all, on Grandma Dobson’s white coverlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the doctor came hurrying down the lane, and
left his horse standing in front of the house. Spry
was the name of the animal, in whom the doctor had
full confidence. Now Spry had, when the May clover
was at its sweetest, carried the doctor along the shore
and out across the bar to the little island, where the
clover is sweeter than any that grows on the old main
land. Spry fully appreciated the clover at the time,
and remembering it still, off he started for the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tide was rising fast. The bar was almost
covered, but Spry got upon it safely and trotted along
the stony way, not minding in the least the spray that
met about his feet. He gained Cloverland Paradise at
last, and when his master, having dressed Harry’s
wounds and properly disposed of his broken arm, went
out to find him, Spry was wandering in fields of sweetness,
and the poor puzzled doctor walked home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Great was the consternation on the island to find the
doctor’s horse feeding there and without his master,
and great was the fear lest the doctor had been
drowned. Spry had to pay for his clover by crossing
the bar at the first moment the tide permitted. The
water poured into the doctor’s carriage, and the man
who drove kept his eyes roving about on every side,
to find some trace of the missing man. It was nearly
dark when he, urging Spry on to his highest speed,
went rushing villageward. As he came to the principal
street, the overhanging elms, whose branches met,
made it seem quite dark.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>At first the man thought he would stop and inquire
if the doctor had reached home, but finally deciding
to go at once to the doctor’s house, he gave Spry a
touch with the whip, which sent the beast on faster
than ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as he gave the stroke he was passing a cornerstore,
before which a group of loungers was standing.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the darkness every one of them recognized the
doctor’s horse, although not one of them recognized
the man who drove.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There goes the doctor’s horse, this minute,” cried
one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The rascal thinks he’ll get off safe,” cried another,
while all together they set up such a shout and cry,
that instantly the street seemed to resound with cries
of “Stop him! Stop him! He’s running off with the
doctor’s horse. Stop, thief!”</p>

<p class='c009'>While the crowd ran on, pursuing as fast as it
could, two men jumped into a wagon and started on
another road. They intended to head the escaping
thief and turn him back, to effect which, they spared
not the horse they drove, but at the end of a mile and a
half, turned triumphantly into the New Haven turnpike,
saying “Now we have him! Spry hasn’t speed
enough to have passed this point. We’ll meet him
presently. He’s one of them good-for-nothing circus
fellows, without any doubt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To their intense disgust and astonishment Spry’s
white face did not appear on the road, nor did they
see it until they reached the doctor’s house, whither
they went to inform him that the horse-thief had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>escaped. They were met as they drove up with shouts
of laughter from the group assembled in the doctor’s
yard. Looking about in the darkness for the cause,
Spry was discerned quietly standing at his accustomed
post, while his master, who had had an unusual amount
of walking to do that afternoon, was waiting to get
his tea, and for the moon to rise before taking the man
back to the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning Mrs. Hallock’s carriage and the
doctor’s gig met at the brown house in Pumpkin
Delight Lane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am so glad to meet you,” said Mrs. Hallock to
the doctor, who was in the act of tying Spry to a
fence-post, not venturing to trust him within smelling
distance of the clover across the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said the doctor, in his straightforward,
brusque way, “you are just the right person in the
right place, but I think these little folks had better stay
in the carriage and take a turn down on the sands,
while you come in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank and Kate were already on the ground, in their
eagerness to see Harry Cornwall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O doctor, please won’t you let him come to our
house?” pleaded Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll have chance enough, my child, to see the
poor fellow. All in good time. Run away now,
both of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Hallock bade Hugo drive on, and return in half
an hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me!” sighed Kate. “It’s too bad we happened
to meet that provoking old doctor, isn’t it? I’m
just crazy to see that boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“I’ll take a run over by myself, by-and-by,” said
Frank, quite loftily. “I dare say there will be something
to fetch over after mamma sees him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll let me come, too, Frank?” asked Kate
beseechingly, with her eyes following the darkness and
light of a bobolink’s twinkling across the green lane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Kate; it isn’t just <i>the thing</i>”—with an air of
superiority quite exasperating to his sister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wasn’t it <i>the thing</i>, as you say, when you wanted a
crust last night? You thought so when you asked me
to fetch it, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O—well. My! Wasn’t that a good dash?” as a
red-winged blackbird shook its dazzle on the blue air;
and then Frank did not seem to think it worth while
to return to the subject, but began to talk quite fast.
“My! Kate,” he ran on, “how I wish you were a
boy—twin-brother to me! I’ll tell you what we’d do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?” came eagerly from Kate, who was so
anxious to do whatever her brother wished, that she
had already secretly resolved to join him in his enterprise,
even though only a girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’d run away and go to sea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O!” exclaimed Kate, quite overcome by surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what do you think about it?”—after a
minute.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would be just splendid!” said Kate. “Only
boys and girls don’t do such things <i>now</i>; they used
to, you know, when they didn’t know any better.”
Kate was thinking just then of the “Children’s
Crusade” and its sad disasters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, not <i>girls</i>,” said Frank; “but I dare say
it’s just as jolly for boys as ever—jollier, maybe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>’cause if one don’t like it, why there’s any number of
ships coming back about every day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe they wouldn’t let <i>you</i> sail in them though,
Frank; and that would be bad—awful bad! If I was
with you now, ’twould be different. They’d let me
sail with them, ’cause I am a girl, and they’d take you
along to take care of me. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, now, Kate, don’t be foolish. You didn’t
suppose I’d let you run away with me, did you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I might go if you didn’t <i>let</i> me, Mr. Frank. Girls
do lots of things now that they didn’t use to do.
Mamma says so; and she’s glad I’m going to have
more chances at something or other—I forget what—than
she had when she was little.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At grammar, perhaps, Kate. Grammar is good
for little girls—keeps them out of mischief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, now!” cried Kate, making a mischievous
dash at Frank’s ear, and missing it. She hit his straw
hat with a force that sent it careering, helped on by the
strong sea-breeze, over the wet sands, along which
they were driving. “See how your hat likes going to
sea all alone, sir, before you start,” laughed Kate;
while Frank sprang down, and went in hot pursuit of
his hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate clapped her hands, and shouted encouraging
words to Frank as he made frantic endeavors to catch
it. The hat seemed like a hunted thing, driven on
from point to point, until reaching a creek running
down from the salt meadows, it rolled airily into it,
and went sailing off slowly toward the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop it! stop it!” shouted Frank to Hugo, who
drove ahead of it, and stopped the carriage midway in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>the stream; while Kate, getting down on the carriage
steps, fished it out with the handle of her parasol,
thereby saving Frank from getting his feet wet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saved by a girl!” laughed Kate, when they had
driven to land and Frank was again by her side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Set adrift by a girl!” exclaimed Frank, who was
really in a bad humor at having his hat wet and dripping,
so that he could not put it upon his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hang it up to dry,” suggested Kate, offering the
point of her parasol to hoist it on in the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank tied it on, and telling Hugo not to hurry, so
that it might have a chance to be wearable by the time
they reached the brown house, they turned toward it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor was already at the gate untying Spry
when they reached it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my little folks,” said he, “is your chance to
see the poor fellow. He’s a plucky lad, and will make
a glorious pull through life, I know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you,” said Frank, although he could not
have told what he was thanking the doctor for, while
Kate, who had made up her mind that Harry was a
kind of hero—what kind she did not know—could have
kissed the old doctor, for just thinking well of the lad.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There! there! It’s all over now, and you’ll have a
nice long rest,” Grandma Dobson was saying, while
she softly patted and petted Harry; and there, right
in the room, having entered like two healthy spirits,
stood Kate and Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry did not see them, for his eyes were covered by
a bandage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank went close to him, saying “I’m the boy who
helped you wash dishes, and, I say, it’s too bad you fell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>and got hurt. Here’s my sister Kate come to see you,
too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m very sorry I can’t see her,” said Harry. “My
head will be all right in a little while. I’m not much
hurt. I felt ashamed to make a noise when the doctor
touched my arm. If you could have seen the poor
folks in the fire, and how brave they were—one
woman carrying her baby two miles with her hands
burned awfully in trying to get it out of the house, you
wouldn’t feel so sorry for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should, Harry,” spoke up Kate, “and I’m Kate
Hallock. I saw you over the stone wall when you
were riding into town on that pony.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry I wasn’t better worth seeing,” said
Harry, “and I’m much obliged to you for coming
here to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wanted to come,” said Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O!” exclaimed Harry, wondering why, but not
venturing to ask the question.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Dobson, mistaking Harry’s exclamation for
one of pain or weariness, adroitly asked Kate and
Frank if they would go out into the field beyond the
garden and help their mother to find some skullcap for
Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Away they ran, eager and anxious to do something,
anything to help.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamma! we’ve seen him. Doctor Hill said we
might,” cried Kate, springing over the low stone wall
that separated Mrs. Dobson’s bit of vegetable garden
from the meadow in which Mrs. Hallock was searching
for skullcap.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“Poor boy! I am very sorry for him,” said Mrs.
Hallock. “No mother, and no home, and it might
have been our Frank, Kate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, mother, it isn’t, you know; and now he’s
going to have a mother and a home, and a brother and
a sister, too. O, I’m so glad the circus came, and
Frank ran away, and everything happened. I’m glad
Harry got hurt, too,” she said, almost under her
breath, “if he’ll only make haste and get well now.
There! is this skullcap?” holding up a cluster of
something green, that she had gathered close to the
wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, child! that is young golden-rod, just out of
the ground. Frank! Frank! come here, and jump
over the wall and get this for me,” called Mrs. Hallock,
but Frank was in great excitement over a young
snake that he had found warming its wriggling,
uncanny self on the stone wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s whipping something!” returned Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank, don’t, don’t do it!” and Kate ran as fast
as she could through the tall June grass toward the
spot where Frank was vigorously switching.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go back! Go back, Kate!” shouted Frank. “It’s
a snake!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate did go back as fast as she could, springing
over the wall right into the midst of Grandma Dobson’s
currant bushes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run! run, mamma!” she shouted, out of breath,
and trembling as only a girl can tremble, at the
thought of a snake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be frightened! it’s only a young black snake.
There’s lots of ’em in the grass down the lane,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Frank, after he had killed the reptile and approached
his mother, who, to tell the exact truth, was standing
quite still, and was afraid to take another step into the
long grass about her feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give me your hand, Frank?” she said, trying to
smile, but looking very white.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, mamma, what is the matter? You haven’t
been bitten, have you?” and with the words, Frank
reached her side and took hold of her outstretched
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Frank.” She tried to smile, but the trial was
such a miserable failure, that she nearly cried instead
of smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, mother,” in a voice of mingled pity and
regret, “I thought you had more courage!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have about some things—bearing a headache,
for instance,” she replied, trying two or three times
before she could get over the low wall into the garden.
By the time she reached the house, she was very glad
to sit down on the broad stone steps at the back door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fetch me some water,” she said, but instead of
going for the water, Kate ran for Mrs. Dobson, who
presently appeared on the scene with a glass of foaming
root beer. “Don’t be afraid of it, Mrs. Hallock.
I made it with my own hands, and I know just what is
in it. I don’t know what to do about the snakes, I’m
sure. Everybody else is afraid of them, but they
never hurt me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t go near them, do you?” gasped Kate,
with her soft brown eyes expressive of extreme horror
at the thought.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Go near snakes! Yes, indeed I do, and talk to
them, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Talk to snakes!” echoed Frank and Kate in
chorus, and even Mrs. Hallock looked up interested.</p>

<p class='c009'>Grandma Dobson was standing in the doorway.
“There! dear me! I near forgot the egg I was beating
up for the lad,” she said, stepping back and taking
up the plate upon which she had the white of an egg.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me do that,” urged Kate; “I know how, I
do it often for mamma. All that she has to say, is
‘Whiff, Kate!’ and I’m on the spot; and I’m there
now; so, please?” extending her hand for the plate
and knife, and adding, “I’m in an awful hurry to hear
what you say to snakes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a bit of a story, and a true one, too,” said Mrs.
Dobson, sitting down in a chair that Frank had the
politeness to offer to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You little folks will wonder that I know about
Indians,” she began, “but there were perhaps a dozen
of the Wepawaugs living here when I was a little girl,
eight years old, or thereabouts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One Indian woman I remember very well—she was
a granddaughter of Ansantawae, a Sachem, and very,
very proud of her ancestors. Her uncle had been the
great medicine man of his tribe: from him, she
learned to make syrups of roots, barks, and herbs, that
she gathered from far and near. She was a clever
soul, everybody trusted her, and when she was going
off once, in the early summer, up to the Southington
mountains to get the things she wanted for her syrups,
I ran away to go with her.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Grandma Dobson!” with bated breath from Kate
and Frank; while Kate from that instant forgot all
about the egg she was beating.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, children, I did, but I was sorry enough before
I got back, I can tell you. I knew when she was
going, for I had been down to see her and to carry to
her some things from my mother, the night before. I
had never seen a mountain, and the very name of one
sounded so grand, that I thought I’d give anything to
see the real thing; so the next morning, when it was
about time for her to start, I started, too, and went
along the road I knew she was going to take—for I
had asked her that. Well, when I got out of the town
where there were no more houses, it seemed so lonely
that I was frightened, and I went behind a big rock
and waited for her to come along.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hadn’t long to wait. She came very fast, standing
up as straight as a pine tree when the wind is still,
and over her shoulder a stout stick with two bundles
on it—one hanging behind, and one before. I knew
if she met me there, she would send me back; so I ran
on behind her. She never looked back once, but
walked so fast that at last I lost sight of her; but I
kept on and on, over hills and down by streams, until I
was tired as I could be. The sun was hot, and I was
hungry, and I came to a place where a road turned off,
and I didn’t know which road she had taken.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wasn’t there any trail?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was only a little girl, and I never thought to look
for footprints; but just as I was standing there, something
spoke to me out of the woods on my left. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>jumped, I can tell you, to hear my name called—‘Dorothy!
Dorothy Ford!’—out of the dark woods.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Where are you going?’ came next; and then I
knew the voice. Anawa was sitting over there, eating
her dinner. I told her I was going with her. At
first she said ‘No, I must go back; yes, the first horse
she met on the road, she would send me home to my
mother.’ She made me sit down on the rock by her,
and eat some of my own mother’s bread and cake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After awhile we got up and went on, but all day
long we did not meet one horse going toward
Wepawaug. Anawa was a good deal vexed when she
had to walk slow, because I was tired. She muttered
away to herself in the Indian language, and now and
then scowled at me, until I was so frightened that I
wanted to cry. It began to grow dark at last, and I
longed to see Pumpkin Delight Lane more than I had
wanted to see the mountains at any time in my life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not see any houses anywhere about, and when
I asked Anawa where she was going to sleep, she
scowled worse than ever, and I said no more until we
reached an Indian cabin—a little more than a wigwam,
but not much like any house that I had ever
stayed in. There was no one in it. The Indian broke
up dry twigs and branches, and made a fire, and cooked
some salt fish that she had in one of her bundles. We
ate the fish and some more of my mother’s bread,
which almost choked me, I remember; and then
Anawa went out of the hut, and left me alone. I
don’t think she was gone long, but it seemed a great
while to me—so long that if it hadn’t been for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>bundles that she left, I should have been afraid she
didn’t mean to come back at all. When she did come
in, she had her arms so full of hemlock boughs, that
I couldn’t tell whether she was pleased or angry. She
made a pile of them on the floor, and bade me ‘to bed’
with an air of authority that I did not dare to resist.
I lay down and went to sleep. Before the sun was up,
she called me, gave me a crust to eat, shouldered her
staff, with its bundle made fast to either end, and
strode on. I followed her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pretty soon we met a boy driving a cow to pasture,
although there was plenty of grass all along the highway;
and then when we had climbed another long hill,
there was a red house in sight. I couldn’t help saying
I wanted a mug of milk. Anawa gave a grunt for
answer; but when she came to the gateway, she
went in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Primrose lived in the red house, and when I
found out that the Indian wished me to stay there until
there was a chance to send me home, I cried, and made
such a fuss about it, that she took hold of my hand,
twitched me out of the house, and down the next hill
as fast as she could go; but as it was not until I had a
nice warm breakfast, I did not care much about it.
After that Anawa begun to talk to me about everything
we saw along the way, and when I got very tired
she sat down and waited until I had rested. After
three days we came to the Southington mountains.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘You’ll see snakes pretty soon,’ she said. Then I
began to be terribly afraid, and to cling to her gown.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Snakes won’t hurt you, if you’re good,’ she said.
‘Keep still now. Hear me!’ She went on a few steps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>and stopped by a big rock and began to say ‘Good, nice
snakes! beautiful creatures! pretty little rattlesnakes!
Anawa won’t hurt you, and you mustn’t hurt her.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“While she said this, I had hidden behind her, and
was so frightened that I could do nothing but gaze
at the snakes on the rock. Anawa’s voice seemed to
charm them. They did not stir or sound a rattle, and
we went on. We were all day on the mountains, and
saw maybe a hundred snakes. She would kneel right
down by the side of a snake and dig roots from the
ground, crooning away to it like a mother to a baby.
Since then I haven’t been very near many snakes, but
I am not afraid of one. I tell a snake just as Anawa
did, that I won’t hurt it if it doesn’t hurt me, and somehow
it seems to understand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never should stay near enough to a snake to speak
to it,” said Mrs. Hallock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nor I,” said Kate, while Frank said,</p>

<p class='c009'>“I couldn’t keep from killing a snake long enough
to speak to it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose boys couldn’t,” said Mrs. Dobson, who,
suddenly remembering the poor lad in the next room,
arose quickly to go to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There comes Josh this minute with a snake,” she
cried, looking toward the garden.</p>

<p class='c009'>Josh—Mrs. Dobson’s shepherd dog—leaped the
stone wall, dragging after him an enormous black
snake that he had met and killed. The good fellow
towed it along to the door, dropped it, and looked up,
wagging his tail, as much as to say, “Praise me, I’ve
done well, the very best I knew how.”</p>

As soon as Mrs. Dobson had told the story
of her runaway trip to the Southington
mountains, she peeped into her bedroom
to see how her poor little lad was getting
on, and found him asleep. Mrs. Hallock,
Kate and Frank went out from the back
door, that they might not awaken him,
and presently Mrs. Dobson saw their carriage
roll away. At the same time her
eyes rested on a bit of the blue of the sea. She had not
been too busy amid all her cares to remember that it
was the anniversary of her wedding day. Thirty-seven
years ago it was that very morning since she
was married and went down to the harbor to see the
<i>Snow</i> start on her voyage to the West Indies. The
very harbor had filled up since then, so that the <i>Snow</i>
could not enter it now even should the unfortunate
ship return; but of this, Mrs. Dobson never thought.
She was not conscious even that she was looking for
the long-lost ship, in which her brave, bright, young
husband sailed. She only went up to the window in
the garret because she had acquired the habit of going
up there in the little pauses she gave to herself in her
busiest days. The daisies were whitening the fields
along the land; the little island wore a blessed, happy
look of rest and peace, amid the twinkle of light and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>water all about it. The Sound was as blue as the sea
is in June. The sand cliffs of Long Island gleamed
white across the twenty miles of water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beyond the island lay a vessel. A row of poplar
trees hid it when first she looked. She gazed at the
boat, thinking almost unconsciously to herself as it
sailed into full view, “Yes, the <i>Snow</i> would look like
that by this time; the sails must be brown and old and
torn by the gales, just as this ship’s sails are.” Looking
down upon her own hand as it lay across the windowledge,
she noticed its wrinkles with sharp and sudden
pain. She too, was grown old. Meanwhile the forlorn looking
craft was sailing in toward the harbor’s
mouth. It was only a coasting vessel laden with coal,
coming in to discharge its cargo at the coal dock.</p>

<p class='c009'>Grandmother Dobson watched it until it was half
way across the bay; Josh gave a bark so loud and
thrilling that the dreaming old lady awoke to the
present, and hurried down. There was no one about
the house, but Harry was awake and talking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to tell her all I know about the necklace,”
she heard him say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me! the poor lad is out of his head, and he
hasn’t had the skullcap yet,” she thought. “My fire
has gone down, too! Josh, fetch me in a stick of
wood,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Josh is a real true dog, and he does bring in
wood—not one stick only, but he fills up the wood-box,
and always expects to be rewarded at the end of his
toil by an extra nice bit to eat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Josh started at once for the woodpile and returned
with a small stick.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“Now, another!” He obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Harry kept saying, “I must tell about
the necklace. Where is she? Won’t you please tell
me if she is here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Fully believing that the boy was talking in delirium,
Mrs. Dobson did not think it worth while to answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She must be deaf,” Harry thought; so, after
awhile, he said no more, but tried with his hand to
move the bandage, so that he could look about a little.
The first thing that his eyes rested upon was a lovely
cluster of roses; Kate had left them, but as she thought
he could not see, she had said nothing of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Dobson!” called Harry as loud as he could
call.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dear little soul hurried into the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, dear Mrs. Dobson, will you put these
flowers in some water? I wish you would let me get
up and do it,” pleaded Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! no! The doctor says you must not get up
to-day, nor to-morrow, and you must promise me not
to try when I am out of the room. If you do I shall
have to put Josh in here and tell him to keep you
in bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is Josh your son?” innocently asked Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Dobson laughed a merry, sunny little laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” she said. “Josh is my dog. He barked a little
while ago to tell me somebody was about. He heard
you talking, I suppose. Josh is a wonderful dog.
You may see him if you promise not to move your
bandage again until I tell you you may.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I promise,” said Harry, “unless the house takes
fire or something else happens.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“I don’t see where the delirium went to so suddenly,”
Mrs. Dobson thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry determined to find out if she would grow
deaf should he ask about the necklace again. He tried
it. Instantly she closed the door, bidding him “go
to sleep and not talk any more,” and he, poor fellow,
had not had his promised glimpse of Josh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry shut his eyes, tried to sleep, tried to stop
thinking about his own old home on the shore of the
lake, in Michigan, but the more he tried the more he
thought about it. Being weak and hurt, he grew
feverish with thinking, and I am sure I do not know
what unfortunate thing would have happened to him,
had Kate Hallock not appeared on the scene.</p>

<p class='c009'>She came laden with good things, or rather the carriage
was laden, and she came with it and them. First
were two large, hard pillows—Mrs. Dobson’s pillows
were small; after the pillows there came a big basket
overflowing with nice, “comforting things to eat.”
Then there were two summer suits of Frank’s clothing—for
either Harry had no change of garments, or
they had been carried away by the “circus folks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to stay with you to-day,” said Kate to
Mrs. Dobson, as the good woman gave expression to
her surprise upon seeing the carriage move off.
“Mamma and I thought maybe you’d like to have me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How kind! I should very much, for now it is time
for my bit of dinner to go on the fire. You may sit in
there,” pointing toward the door of Harry’s room,
“but I wouldn’t talk much if I were you, for I believe
he is just the least mite out of his head now and then.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Kate went in cautiously. The boy did not hear her.
He thought he was alone, for he heard the sound of
Mrs. Dobson’s movements in the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>He sighed two or three times, and moved his left
arm uneasily toward his eyes. At last he said, “Dear
me! I wish I hadn’t promised. I do want to see out a
bit, and know where I am.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m here,” said Kate. “I’ll tell you all about it.
Did you see the house when you were brought into
it last night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t know anything at all from the time I was
on the pony until I heard somebody say, ‘He will need
something to eat by-and-by, Mrs. Dobson,’ and I
wondered who Mrs. Dobson was, and who would want
something to eat. Pretty soon I moved a little, and
then I began to understand, for somebody took hold
of my arm and said, ‘You mustn’t move nor try to
move, either,’ and then she told me who she was, and
how I had fallen, and been fetched here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shut your eyes and try to see what I am going
to tell you about,” said Kate. “I often make Frank
try, but he can’t do it very well. In the first place,
turn your head that way—so,” turning Harry’s face
to the east; “there is the sea, the Sound—Long Island
Sound is its real name—and it’s about a mile away;
then,” turning his face about toward the north,
“running right along past here is a road—no, a lane—Pumpkin
Delight Lane, it is called. Funny, isn’t it?
Well, this is the last house between the village and the
sea. It is old, ever so old. The boards—clapboards I
guess—are wrinkled—shrunken I mean—so that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>kind of peal up all around and look as though they’d
like to be pulled off. It’s brown, the house is; never
been painted, perhaps; anyway, it’s a great deal
prettier than painters’ brown paint; and there is one
chimney that looks, on the outside, just as though it
was right in the middle of the house. It is a stone
chimney, too, and when you get well, Mrs. Dobson will
let you go up the staircase—that’s stone, too—up into
her garret, where you can see way out to sea, ever so
far.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But who lives here, besides Mrs. Dobson?” interrupted
Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Josh. Mrs. Dobson and just Josh, that’s all.
Queer, isn’t it, a woman and a dog? Mrs. Dobson
won’t go away from here to live, either. This was her
father’s house, and her mother lived in it, and all her
brothers and sisters, too; and,” said Kate in a whisper,
“her husband, Mr. Dobson, went away to sea the very
morning they were married, and he’s never come back
in all this time; nor anybody who went with him,
either. Mother told Frank and me all about it; and
her mother told her, when she was quite a little girl,
and,” breathed Kate, in a lower whisper, “don’t tell,
ever. But Frank and me guess that she thinks he’ll
come back again, and that’s the reason she won’t go
away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, my!” sighed Harry, “that’s worse, ever so much
worse, than knowing that your folks are dead; ’cause
then you know they can’t come back any more, and so
you don’t keep looking out all the time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate wanted very much to ask Harry about his
folks, but she thought she ought not to do it; it might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>make him feel worse to talk about it; so, not knowing
what else to say to divert him, she said, “Let’s play he
comes back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he can’t! so many years, you know,”
exclaimed Harry, raising himself energetically from
his pillows.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That makes it better fun, don’t you see?” said
Kate; “harder to make out where he has been all this
time—most forty years! Dear me, he must be very old
now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Harry, “and burned black, maybe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How? You don’t suppose the <i>Snow</i> burned up,
do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, I mean by the sun,” laughed Harry. “Going
to the West Indies, did you say the ship was?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Kate, fairly beside herself with excitement.
“O, you’re jolly good help, making believe;
ever so much better than Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did the <i>Snow</i> carry? Let us be careful and
have things all right,” urged Harry, interested
because Kate was, and anxious to help her on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure I don’t know. O, molasses and rum, I
heard once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, no! Molasses and rum you mean they were
going to fetch back,” suggested Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, that was it,” said Kate; “and we’ll play they
were going out there with a shipload of dolls for the
little West Indian girls for Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid that won’t do,” said Harry, doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not, pray?” said Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Forty years ago I’m afraid there wasn’t a shipload
of dolls in every one of our States put together.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“O, never mind! we can play so, if there wasn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if it’s going to be all play we’ll go ahead,”
said Harry. “The <i>Snow</i> was loaded with dead dolls
and live monkeys, and every monkey had a doll, and
when they got to the West Indies the monkeys all ran
away with the dolls, and so the poor little West Indian
girls got none.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How ridiculous!” cried Kate, laughing heartily.
“Now let me see, the <i>Snow</i> was going and going, and
sailing right on night and day, and day and night,
when it struck a—a snag.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that?” cried Harry, with a shout of laughter.
“A snag in the ocean!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, something that boats always hit that sinks
them,” said Kate, a little red in the face. “I know;
for my aunt was on a ship that went against one, and
sunk too; ’cause she wrote all about it after she got
home. I know it was a snag, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But that was on a river, not a sea. A snag is an
old tree or something that gets caught in the mud and
is under the water,” corrected Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O!” said Kate, glad that Harry was blindfolded.
“Well, we’ll have something else, then—a big storm,
hills and mountains of running waves, awful thunder
and lightning, and the ship gets struck by lightning—no,
by a big wave, and tumbles all to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the dolls all spill out and go floating off!”
suggested Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How can you at such an awful time think of
making fun?” asked Kate, “just as the ship had been
struck by lightning, too!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“Thunder—no, a big wave,” interposed Harry.
“Don’t you remember ’twas a big wave that tumbled
everything?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Kate reflectively, “and Captain Dobson—he’s
captain, you know—stands on the last plank
of the <i>Snow</i> (good captains always do that—the last
plank of the ship, remember), and when the ship went
down, the plank floated off with Captain Dobson on it.
That’s all right, so far, isn’t it?” she added inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right but the monkeys, you forgot and left
them to go down with the ship,” said Harry. “Instead
of that they went swimming off, each monkey with a
doll in its arms, and two of them got on the same
plank the Captain was on, and he——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! no!” cried Kate, jumping up from her chair
by the window, and in her eagerness sitting down on
the bed, forgetting all about Harry’s feet. “You
musn’t, musn’t say that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say what, pray?” and Harry tried to draw up his
feet, but Kate held them fast, and did not even know
where she was, or what she was doing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, you were going to make Captain Dobson
push the poor monkeys off the plank, and—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I was not,” interrupted Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really, you frightened it all out of my head. Let
me think!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, I know!” joyfully cried Kate, clapping her
palms. “There was the mast—there always is a mast
or a smoke-stack, or something to climb. This is it:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the monkeys leaped from the plank to the mast,
and ran up to the top of it and waved the dolls—all
dressed in white, you see, with long, long sashes, that
would float a good ways, you know; and somebody in
a boat way off, on—on—the horizon’s edge”—Kate
felt proud after saying “horizon’s edge,” and was
greatly mortified at hearing from under the bedclothes
a smothered laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like to know what you are laughing at,”
she said, with sudden gravity, slipping down from the
bed, to Harry’s most comfortable relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t mean to laugh; really and truly I did not,”
said Harry, moving up his bandage the least mite in
the world, as he afterward admitted to Mrs. Dobson.
“But how could I help it; it is so like a girl. Now
my mast, if it had floated at all, would have lain down
on the water just like any other big stick; but yours
you could make stand up and sail around, just as
easy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, never mind!” said Kate, immensely relieved
on finding out that Harry was not laughing at her
attempt at fine effect, “that’s nothing! all sorts of
impossible things do happen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doll’s sash ribbons soaked in salt water don’t make
very good signals, anywhere, I don’t believe,” said
Harry. “I think we might manage that part better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we can’t stop, don’t you see,” said Kate hurriedly,
“to be so very careful about everything.
Nobody ever does when there’s a poor fellow on a
last plank, floating on the wide ocean; they just try to
get him off and into a boat as quick as ever they can,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>and rub him up, and give him something to eat, and
everything, particularly” (Kate couldn’t get over that
word very fast) “when the man is such a dear, good,
nice man, like Captain Dobson.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Josh, hearing the animated voices in Mrs.
Dobson’s bedroom, had opened the door a bit with his
nose, without attracting any notice; and as the dear
old lady, her thoughts busy with the past, was carrying
a pail of water into the kitchen, Kate’s last words fell
full upon her ears. She dropped the pail, being too
much startled to put it quite in its place, and with
flushed face, tearful eyes, and trembling tones,
appeared to the children, saying, “Tell me quick!
don’t wait a bit! is there any news of Captain
Dobson?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry pushed his bandage aside, and said, with
sincere sorrow, “No, no! Mrs. Dobson; not a word.
We were only”—he stopped, with an instinctive feeling
that they had been very unfeeling to make-believe
on the subject at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate took up his sentence bravely. “I’ll tell you all
about it, dear Mrs. Dobson,” throwing her arms
about the old lady and urging her to a seat in a rocking
chair. “It was all me, every bit of it; and we
were just trying to make-believe that he got saved
when the <i>Snow</i> went down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did the <i>Snow</i> go down? Who knows?” she
asked, sobbing and crying, and quite broken down by
hearing the fact put into words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry we said a word,” said Kate, crying with
Mrs. Dobson; and, dropping down upon a footstool,
she laid her head in Mrs. Dobson’s lap.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“You will please forgive us, won’t you?” spoke up
the boy in the bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Forgive you! Yes, indeed. I’m glad you thought
enough about my poor—about Captain Dobson to talk
of him at all, and to-day, too! Why, I always go down
the harbor to-day; it is just thirty-seven years ago
to-day since we were married and the ship went on
its voyage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you will go this afternoon, won’t you?” questioned
Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mustn’t,” she said simply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I’ve got a little boy of my own to look after
to-day, don’t you see?” she said, suddenly smiling,
with an uplifted face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate sprang up and kissed her, saying, with an arch
look at Harry, whose eyes she looked into for the first
time, “Why, you can go. I’ll take care of—the little
boy while you are gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, my dear child!” cried Mrs. Dobson, as she
espied Harry’s eyes, and caught sight of the ugly
wound across his eye-brow, “didn’t you promise me
not to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless the house was on fire, or something happened;
and something did happen. I was afraid we
had killed you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kate! Kate! mother says you must come home to
dinner right away,” said Frank, who had suddenly
appeared on the scene; “and” (on his own authority)
“you must go this very minute.”</p>

Kate Hallock knew just as well as
could be that Mrs. Dobson was going to
have something nice for dinner, for when
Frank went out to order her home a
savory odor followed him. She wished
very much to stay, and lingered about the
kitchen, half hoping and altogether wishing
that Mrs. Dobson would invite her to
stay to dinner: but the dear little woman
only looked up from her boiling and baking to say—Mrs.
Dobson always called Kate “Kittie, my Clover”—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now Kittie, my Clover, if you and Frank will
come over and stay from five to seven this afternoon,
I shall be very glad to go out a little while.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Grandma Dobson,” cried Kate, “how that
fire is burning your face up; I wouldn’t cook when
’twas so warm, if I were you. Let me turn over that
meat, I won’t drop it in the fire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind me, I am used to it,” said Mrs.
Dobson, bending over the glowing coals, glad to bury
her face anywhere from Kate’s sharp eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, if you won’t let me help you, I am
going home, and I’ll come before five o’clock, and stay
till you get back, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these words Kate went skipping through the
hall and out at the front door. Once outside, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>happiness burst into a positive run. It was too far
around by the highway to Hallock Point, besides Kate
felt just as every healthy young thing feels at some
time on the way through the child-years, that everybody’s
highways were not the ways to go in that day,
so she would make her own path across the fields.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pumpkin Delight Lane ran down to the sea, and
Hallock Point extended into the sea beyond the coast
line. Between the two lay grassy meadows—a depression
in the level, up which the old ocean crept twice in
the year, and also in great storms; a bit of a wood,
beyond which came salt meadow again; and then the
uplands, rising to the Point. It seemed a very short
cut home to Kate. The bewitching greens that lay
rolled in long and wide breadths for her feet to tread
had all been prepared by Madame June, the best
carpet-maker in the zone. Kate climbed the stone
wall opposite Mrs. Dobson’s house, and not a soul saw
her disappear into the grass behind it, save Josh, if
indeed Josh has a soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate danced all over. She was so full of the sap
of June that she could no more keep quiet than could
the buzzing, whirring, nodding, flying things about
her. She clapped her hands and cried, “O, my!” as a
mad bobolink, on his way to the Wood Asylum, filled
her ears with crazy melody.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate grew practical as the great, round, purple
clover-heads nodded to her out of the tall grass.
“Yes, I’ll get you, my beauties,” she cried. “Mother
is so fond of dried grasses and things when the fall
comes, and it’s just the time and chance to get some.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Presently her small hands were filled to their utmost
capacity, and yet she had not half enough. Her apron
proved too small before she had crossed a single field,
and the first fence surprised her with her gathered-up
dress skirt running over with bobbing grasses.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next came a field of rye. “Rye is real pretty on the
walls with fern and oak leaves,” she said, and she
took a few heads in advance of the reapers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate trudged on, past and through lot after lot,
until she came to the bit of woodland. She went into
it. So intent was she in watching to see where a bluebird
carried its mouthful of worm, that she stumbled
over a dead branch, and fell at the foot of a huge
hickory tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gathering up first herself and then her own hat and
grasses, she proceeded to arrange them into portable
form, while she rested at the foot of the tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, Josh, having seen Kate go over the wall,
watched for her to reappear, but seeing no signs of
such an event, after suitable time, the wise dog crossed
the street and mounted the wall, looking as knowing
and discreet as only Josh can look. He surveyed the
scene to his own satisfaction, and then taking Kate’s
trail, followed it and came up to her just as she seated
herself to rest and fix the grasses under the walnut
tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did him think I was lost?” cried Kate. “Good
fellow, good fellow, Josh!” patting him, and very
glad of his companionship. When all was ready Kate
started for home, laughing at herself as she went, and
not in the least surprised at Josh because he barked at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>her, for, truly, she was a surprising figure to bird
or beast, as she emerged from the wood and stood
looking at the bewitching green of the salt meadow
through which she must pass. Her white apron was
small, but she had made the most of it by tying a huge
bunch of grasses with the end of either string, thus
making a very full and bunched over-skirt at the back,
while the bib of apron was made to do duty as grass-holder
to its fullest extent. She had taken pains to
put the stems all down, and as her bib was wide and
stretched across to her shoulders, the grassy fringe
stood up to her ears and nearly blinded her. Her hat
was also alive with oats, rye, and clover. No wonder
that Josh barked when she started, but she did wonder
why he kept on barking harder than ever, until she
reached the edge of the very bright green grass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me! I most wish I hadn’t come this way,
Josh,” Kate said, putting her feet in daintily and
afraid she should get them wet. If there was one
thing that Kate Hallock disliked to do more than every
other thing, it was to “change her stockings and shoes
in the day-time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She picked her way with a good deal of care for
awhile; the dog following her and looking with
evident interest at her over-skirt and hat. And then,
finding that the ground was pretty firm and the sun
getting very hot, Kate hurried on. She was about
half way across the meadow, when she felt herself on
marshy ground. The grass was too deep to see, but
she was sure that her feet were wet, and ’twas getting
harder and harder to walk, with every step.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Dear me! what shall I do?” she cried. “Josh!
Josh! don’t go! Here, Josh!” and every instant, with
every step, Kate Hallock was sinking deeper and
deeper into the black mud. Finally she could go no
further, for she was fast in the horrid swamp, and,
worse than all, every effort that she made to get out
only served to get her in deeper still.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if anybody ever got stuck here before,
and what will become of me?” thought poor Kate,
adding consolingly to herself the words spoken aloud,
“Anyway, they love me well enough at home to find
me before I die, even if I am here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as Josh understood the condition of affairs,
he began to bark as loud as he could, but there was
not a soul near to hear, although Kate could see distinctly
the windows of her home. He barked until
he was hoarse; then he got as near to Kate as he could
and looked at her consolingly and determinedly; and
then he gave his bushy tail a wag or two and started
for home. The very idea of being left there alone
without Josh even, was so utterly horrible to the poor
little prisoner, shorter, if not smaller than ever, now
that she was one-third engulfed, and sinking still,
that it seemed unbearable, and she called frantically to
Josh to come back and stay with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bewildered dog turned and taking her dress in
his teeth, pulled until it gave way, leaving a fragment
of the slight muslin in his mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can’t, you cannot pull me out,” cried Kate,
and then she remembered the story her mother had
told her so often about stopping to think what might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>be done, and she held fast to Josh’s collar while she
tried to think what she could do to bring someone to
her aid.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold, hold on, Josh!” she said, after a moment.
“Now if I only had a pencil and some paper, I might
send you home with a note fast to your neck; but I
haven’t, and what am I to do? My apron I could
spare, but then no one would know by it what’s happened
to me. I’ll send my hat. Hold here, Josh”—taking
it off and tying it as well as she could, for Josh
resisted, on his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>She then let him go, and the dog bounded across
marsh and field for home, springing into Mrs. Dobson’s
kitchen just at the moment when, having given
Harry Cornwall his dinner, she had taken her chair to
eat her own. Kate’s sun hat was still pendant at his
neck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Josh! you rascal, come here! you naughty
dog, you! You’ve run off with Kate’s hat, and left her
to go home in the sun.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Josh could not deny the charge, but he lifted his
nose toward the low ceiling and uttered howl after
howl in a manner that frightened his mistress exceedingly,
for Josh was not “given to howling,” she told
Frank a minute later, as she begged him to go and see
what it all meant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Mrs. Dobson, it’s nothing, I know—only one
of Kate’s tricks,” said Frank; “but to please you,
I’ll go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Josh began to prance and leap, and bark with joy,
as he followed, with Frank, Kate’s footprints across
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the dusty road; but when he bounded over the fence,
Frank stopped—</p>

<p class='c009'>“See here, old fellow!” he cried, “I’m not going
into that grass to please you; I’ve too much respect
for snakes, sir.” And to the dog’s intense disgust, the
boy turned back and reëntered the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s nothing,” he again assured Mrs. Dobson.
“The dog only wanted me to race in the lot with him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The lot!” cried the little woman, running up the
stairway to get a good outlook. “You don’t s’pose,
do you, that your sister tried to go home ’cross lots?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just like her to do it,” replied Frank, who had
followed her up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And got into the swamp-mud,” continued Mrs.
Dobson, just as though Frank had not interrupted her,
“and sent Josh home with her bonnet on, to let us
know?” she finished, all in one breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Dobson and Frank were already looking across
the fields; but the salt meadows, where Kate was
prisoned, were hidden from sight by the strip of woodland.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I might have known better than to look,” said
Mrs. Dobson, going down. “You must run up to Mr.
Bryan’s, and get someone to go where the dog leads.
It’s just noon time, and the men folks’ll be at home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>During this interval of not many minutes, Josh had
been keeping up such a dismal howl out by the front
gate that Harry Cornwall had disobeyed orders—gotten
out of his bed, pushed up his bandage, and was
peeping out of the window to see what it all meant,
when he heard Mrs. Dobson and Frank on the stairs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>In his effort to hurry back into bed, he overturned a
chair with his dinner-dishes on it (Frank, in boy-fashion,
having put them upon the chair, instead of
the table). The clatter and breakage brought Mrs.
Dobson and Frank in a hurry into the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did it,” cried Harry. “I expect you’ll have to
kill me, Mrs. Dobson, unless you let me get well fast,
and work and earn enough to buy new dishes. I’m
just as sorry as I can be; but the dog made such a
fuss, I wanted to see what had happened.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry hid his face under the clothes when he had
made his confession, and consequently did not see
Mrs. Dobson’s imperious gesture to Frank Hallock,
bidding him be gone with haste. She was too intent
on thinking of “Kittie, my Clover,” to care for broken
crockery just then, and did not notice even that one
of her mother’s precious china cups had been cracked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t you please forgive me?” pleaded Harry,
peering forth cautiously, and watching her as she
gathered the pieces.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, for breaking your dishes and being so
naughty,” said Harry, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, I was thinking of the swamps and Katie Hallock,”
 she said, hastily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I forgive you. Go to sleep now. I sha’n’t
open this door again or let anybody come nigh you, in
as much as an hour,” and with the words she closed
the door. If Harry had peeped out the window two
minutes later he would have seen Mrs. Dobson, in an
old-fashioned gingham sunbonnet, taking her way as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>fast as she could, whither Josh led her, through grass
and grain, straight for the salt meadow.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Master Frank, he had taken his way, whistling
as he went, to farmer Bryan’s and told him that
he guessed, maybe, his sister Kate was fast in the bog.
Having heard the boy’s story, Mr. Bryan, with his
“farm hand,” Dick Dawson, started in haste, and so
came up to the stone wall just in time to catch a
glimpse of the fluttering cape of Grandma Dobson’s
sunbonnet on the farther side of the field of rye.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There she goes, this minute! My! what a hurry
she is in—just as though our Kate was a lump of salt
or sugar,” exclaimed Frank, jumping cautiously into
the grass from the wall, and taking especial care to
get between Mr. Bryan and Dick Dawson, because he
considered the position one of greater security from
snakes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, youngster,” replied the sturdy farmer,
“let me tell you, it is no laughing affair to get into that
black sticking-plaster over yonder. More than one
man has, in my day, come near losing his life in the
salt marshes hereabout, and if your twin sister is
prisoned over here, I reckon we shall need a few fence
rails before we can get her out; so you may as well
shoulder your share, if you’re coming along. Here,
take this,” as he balanced a stout rail on Frank’s
shoulder, and then pulled, with the “farm hand’s”
assistance, four more from the fence. Thus armed,
the trio proceeded to the scene of action.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Grandma Dobson had gone on as fast as
she could to the very edge of the salt meadow, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>called in her trembling tones to poor Kate to “Never
mind, somebody would be right along and get her
out.” And Kate, burned red in the face by the June
sun and by the hot tears she had shed, had called
back—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sinking clear down, ever so far. I wish they’d
hurry and make haste.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then the men and Frank arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See the little thing!” called Mrs. Dobson to them.
“Pray, get her out and carry her to the other side, and
see that she gets home in safety.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stay back there, youngster!” cried stout farmer
Bryan to Frank. But whenever did any boy think
there was danger for himself? Carefully advancing,
rail in hand, ready to put it down at the first bit of
uncertain ground, one man went, the other followed,
until they came quite near Kate, who was crying still,
she could not tell why, but Frank said, “probably
because she was sorry to get out; girls always did
such queer, contrary things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Putting a rail on either side of the child, the men
stood on it, and pulled Kate’s arms until she was
“sure” they would pull them off; but at length she
felt herself rising, rising, until she was even with the
earth once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>With much exertion the opposite side was reached,
and just as Kate’s feet were on firm ground a cry from
Frank was heard. His story, as afterwards told, was
that he had been so anxious to follow Kate home and
see the fun, that he had determined to step very light
and fast, and he knew he shouldn’t have time to sink;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Kate wouldn’t, if she hadn’t been so frightened the
minute she began to go down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, there, youngster,” cried Mr. Bryan, “it’s
just good enough for you! You can get out as you
got in,” and without waiting an instant he lifted Kate
in his stout arms and bore her away across meadow
and farm lot toward her home, followed by his
assistant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s too bad—real mean on a fellow! I’ll pay you
up for this!” moaned Frank, who, the more determined
he grew to get out, the deeper he got in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Dobson went as near to Frank as she thought
it prudent to venture, and assured him that the men
would return that way and release him; she knew
they would, and she must go home. Even Josh only
wagged his tail at Frank, as he bounded past to follow
his mistress, and never once dreamed that it was necessary
to stay with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>For more than a half hour Frank stayed there, and
even when the men did return and drag him out, he
did not seem suitably thankful, and would have
insisted on remaining in the wood but for the snakes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before five of the clock, Kate, restored to cleanliness
and comfort, and accompanied by her mother, drove
up to the brown house in the lane. She had returned
to keep her promise to Grandma Dobson.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank, on inquiry, was found sitting in the sun out
at the back door, determined to dry the mud until it
would all rub off, and quite too proud to accept the
offer of a pair of clean stockings from Mrs. Dobson;
but he was very glad of the opportunity afforded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the arrival of Neptune to get home without being seen.
He crept around the house as he heard the doctor
going in at the front door, sprang into the pony carriage,
and was half way to Hallock Point before his
mother or Kate missed Neptune from the gate.
When Frank also was found missing, no further
anxiety was felt concerning the safety of the horse;
and in less than an hour, Frank reappeared, as fresh
and good-tempered as Kate herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Dobson had gone on her errand down the
harbor, with no one to watch her movements; and as
Frank appeared in the room, on his return, Harry
Cornwall, with the bandage removed from his eyes,
was, Kate said, “telling us the interestingest story,
better than any book story in the whole world.”
Frank was sorry that he had not heard the beginning
of the story; but unless he knows it already, he will
have a chance to read it in the next chapter.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Kate Hallock had no sooner shut the
front door of the brown house in Pumpkin
Delight Lane on that eventful day in June,
than Harry Cornwall remembered the
necklace story.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Call her back,” he cried to Frank, who
was rocking away as hard as he could, and
fanning himself furiously with his straw
hat, as he sat in Grandma Dobson’s large
rocking chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What for? She’s gone home to dinner; mother
said she must,” replied Frank, rocking a bit farther
and faster than before he was requested to call her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I wanted to tell her about the necklace,” and
Harry’s face flushed with his eagerness to get the story
off his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I do declare!” laughed Frank. “Just as
though you hadn’t had three or four mortal hours, this
very day, to tell it in! I should like to know what
you two have been talking about all the time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Plenty of things; but I never once thought of the
necklace,” sighed repentant Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well! tell <i>me</i>—that will do just as well,” urged
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed. I’ll tell no one but the owner of that
bit of gold, where I’ve seen it.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“You’ve never seen <i>my</i> Kate’s gold necklace,”
spoke up Frank, indignant, he knew not why, at
Harry’s assurance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have, then; and what’s more, I mean to get it
back again for her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me how.” Frank had ceased from rocking,
and leaned quite near Harry, full of interest and eager
with curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell <i>her</i>,” was all that Harry would say; and
soon after that the anxiety regarding Kate arose, and
the subject was forgotten.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later in the afternoon, Grandma Dobson having
gone on her little expedition, while Mrs. Hallock sat
beside an open window near Harry’s bed, and Kate,
on the low stone step outside the front door, was
making dandelion curls, and thinking how dreadful
it would have been if a big tide had dashed in and
surged over the salt meadow and drowned Kate Hallock,
Harry remembered the so-oft-forgotten circlet
of gold, and he started from his pillow, saying: “I
want to tell her <i>now</i>, this minute, before I forget it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate was summoned. She gathered up in her apron
the piles of curls that she had made, and went in haste
to hear what proved to be quite a story.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe,” said Harry, “you’d like to know what
became of your pretty necklace, that you tucked into
somebody’s vest-pocket that went out West once upon
a time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did <i>you</i> know?” cried Kate, stopping in the
center of the room, and getting so surprised and confused
and flushed, and everything, that she let fall her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>dandelion curls on Grandma Dobson’s lovely rag
carpet, and instantly fell upon her knees to gather
them up again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, your brother told me that you put it in the box;
but he does not know how I came to see it after it
came out of the box. Jack Flibbit—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a funny name!” cried Kate. “Is he a little
boy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and a fisherman’s boy, too; and he was left
all alone after the fires—for his father and mother,
and every one of his folks, were caught in the house,
and hadn’t time to get away; and Jack was staying
that night in a house down by the lake, or he would
have been lost, too. So after it was all over, Jack
was taken by a good, kind lady to Port Huron, and
everybody felt so sorry for him that when he got there
somebody gave him out of one of the boxes a very
nice suit of clothes, and I saw Jack when he was carrying
it along the street. When he met me, he wanted
me to see it, and wouldn’t let me go until after we had
been in and sat down on the steps of a church, and
opened the bundle. Well, when it was open, and he
shook out the little vest, there jingled down on the
stone something that I picked up; it was a necklace,
and I ’most know ’twas yours, ’cause I remember there
was something inside it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, what?” cried Kate. Mrs. Hallock had ceased
to sew in her eagerness to learn more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Harry, “there was so much to remember
about then, that maybe I’m not right; but it was,
I reckon, something like this: ‘Kate; from Grandmother
De—De—Deborah,’ or something like that.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“That’s just it—my own Grandma Hallock’s right
name!” cried Kate; “and I s’pose I was very wicked
to give it away, only everybody was so sorry then for
the poor, burnt-out folks, and I hadn’t anything else
that I thought as much of to give.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is all very wonderful, my boy,” said Mrs. Hallock.
“Do you know what became of Jack Flibbit?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, no, ma’am,” said Harry, “I do not. He was
too small for any circus company to take along, and
there wasn’t anybody belonging to him that he knew
of anywhere; and I don’t quite believe that folks who
live out West care so much about children who are left
alone as you do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, yes, Harry. Kind folks live everywhere, only
one does not always seem able to find them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” said Harry. “I went a long ways and
waited a good while, and now as soon as I get well,
won’t you please find some work for me to do, so that
I can pay back Mrs. Dobson?—for she isn’t very rich,
I don’t think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Harry Cornwall!” exclaimed Kate. “There’s
plenty of work for you to do. There’s your cornfield
to take care of, for one thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My cornfield!” laughed Harry, thinking that Kate
was making fun of him, and quite ready to join in her
merriment, but Mrs. Hallock quickly bade Kate to be
quiet; and immediately she asked Harry to tell how he
escaped from the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My father’s house,” said Harry, “was not very
far from Rock Falls, on the shore of the lake—Lake
Huron, I mean—and the Saturday before the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>fire burned Rock Falls, my father went into the village
and took me with him. After we started for home—it
was almost night then—the smoke grew thick away
off in the distance, and some men we met told father
that they wanted him to go with them and help fight
the fire down, for fear ’twould get to the houses. He
didn’t know what to do with me, but I told him I could
run right back and find a place to stay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Go to my house! go to my house,’ said three or
four of the men, and so my father told me to jump out
and take good care of myself, and I called back to him
to take care of mother, and then I went back. On the
way, I met some little children, and they asked me
where I was going—so I told them what father had
gone to do, and that I was going to somebody’s house,
somewhere, to stay all night, and they said: ‘You
can come to our house and stay.’ So I went home
with them and the next day was Sunday. Sunday
night it looked awful when it grew dark to see the
fires burning all around, except on the side where the
lake was, but we were told to go to bed and if the fire
came any nearer we should be called. We were
called and shaken and pulled from our beds and bidden,
with blankets in our arms, to run for Mr. Huxtable’s
house on the shore of the lake. When we got there
we pounded and screamed at every door and window.
Presently a door opened and out rushed the entire
family, eight in all, and in their night clothes.
The fire was so hot as it came down, like—I don’t
know what it was like—only it was so <i>awful</i> that
<i>nobody</i> could tell about it. It burned us as we ran,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Mr. Huxtable crying out, ‘Come! Come to the lake!
the boat lies there.’ We all got into it, but the men
had to push it out into the water, for we could not
endure the heat. Then the smoke grew so thick that
we could not tell where we were going and there was
not a thing in the boat to guide it by, but the wind
carried us swiftly where it was so cold that we shook
and shivered. Mrs. Huxtable kept a single blanket
and the others were given to the men, who were in
their night clothes. She gathered the little ones
within the blanket and hugged them until they fell
asleep. For nearly two days the waves were all about
us and we had only water from the lake to drink, but
at last we were picked up and taken into Port Huron.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what about yourself? Tell us what you did
after that,” urged Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—why I—went back to Rock Falls. What else
could I do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then?” urged Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not ask Harry unless he chooses to tell,” said
Mrs. Hallock, wiping her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I do; I must,” said Harry. “I shall feel
better when I have told it all. And it is only that
when I got back to Rock Falls, and went to the place
where my father’s house had been, there was nothing
there but burned beams and dry ashes; and when I
asked for my father and mother, a man told me to go
with him, and he showed me ever so many new graves,
and told me where my father and mother lay. Folks
tried to be good to me, but I walked a long way—ever
so many days. I wanted to get just as far away
from there as ever I could.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“But, my boy, had you no uncles nor aunts?” asked
Mrs. Hallock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, yes. There was Uncle Horace—he lived in
Maine, I believe; and mother had a good many letters
from him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is his other name?” questioned Kate.
“Won’t it be splendid, mamma, to find Harry’s uncle
for him; and maybe he will be rich and capital and
everything,” cried Kate, full of glee in an instant, and
she evinced it by clapping her hands and jumping in
true girl fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry’s face flushed as he answered, “I don’t know
his other name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t know!” uttered Mrs. Hallock in a voice that
betrayed more astonishment than she intended to
evince.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what was your mother’s name?” she added,
being quite certain that some clue might be obtained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bessie, Bessie Blake,” said Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>The same evening Mrs. Hallock addressed a letter to
Mr. Horace Blake, Solon, Maine, hoping that by the
time Harry was able to be about again, that she should
have found an uncle for him. She waited patiently
until it was July, and yet no letter came from Mr.
Horace Blake.</p>

<p class='c009'>For many days Frank and Kate had made daily, and
semi-daily, and still-more-daily visits to the brown
house in the lane; and at last the very day was come
for Harry’s first visit to Hallock Point.</p>

“I’m just as sure as anything that there’ll
be a letter to-day from that Mr. Blake up
in Maine, and I wish Hugo would hurry
up and go to the postoffice, before he
goes for Harry and Grandma Dobson.”
Kate Hallock had said the above while
standing in her own room in front of her
dressing bureau, in whose drawers she
was vainly searching for a ribbon with
which to tie her hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kate, Kate, my child!” and a firm hand was laid
upon Kate’s arm, arresting her movements.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know, mamma!” said Kate, “but I put every
single thing in apple-pie order only Saturday, and this
is Tuesday, and I was looking for my blue hair ribbon;
and I’m in an awful hurry, for fear they’ll get here
before I’m ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think any little girl can be <i>ready</i> to receive
company whose bureau drawers are in this state,
Kate?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am, if my hair is only nice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And don’t you think while you were at play a
vision of the confusion here would come up before
you? Just look!” and Mrs. Hallock opened drawer
after drawer, while Kate hung her head, pouted a
little, and said finally,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now, mamma, I <i>will</i> fix everything nice the
first thing in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“Now is the time, my child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t do it now,” pleaded Kate; “they’ll get
here before I’m half done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now is the right time. If I compel you to do it
<i>now</i>, the next time you want a ribbon or a handkerchief,
you will not stir up everything within reach to
find it. You might put your drawers in order every
morning of your life, and it would be of little use if
you threw things right and left, and twisted them over
and over like this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I get in such an awful hurry, and my eyes
dance so I can’t stop, and the first I know everything
begins to hop, skip, and jump under my fingers,” said
poor Kate, bursting into tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear child,” said her mother, “life must not be
such a whirl to you; let me think what to do with
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Send me to the Reform School in Meriden!”
sobbed Kate, with her head on the marble of the
bureau.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here you are at your own Reform School, Kate
Hallock! It is left to you to decide how soon you can
go out free and happy. I’m going down now, and
when you have put everything here in order, you may
call me to look at your work. Here is a chance for
victory over Mr. Disorder, Kate. See that you put
him down completely.” Mrs. Hallock kissed the back
of Kate’s neck, and left the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The white clock on the mantelshelf in the library
struck ten. Kate heard the sweet, silvery sounds as
she listened to her mother’s footsteps on the stairs.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“It’s a great deal too bad, anyhow!” she said,
raising her head, and fumbling blindly, through her
tears, in the open drawer for a handkerchief. “I
think she might just have let me wait till morning,
and not spoiled all my fun to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless Kate kneeled down, and drew out the
lower drawer, and began the labor of assorting,
refolding, and laying in order the various garments
that she found there. She grew interested in her
work. When she closed the first drawer, she jumped
up with glad alacrity, opened the second one, made
two or three very wry faces at the confusion of ribbons,
ruffles, aprons, stockings, and what not besides,
therein; and saying, “Get out of here, Mr. Disorder—I’m
coming to oust you,” she fell bravely to work,
and was upon the last drawer when, with the smallest
possible hint of a knock, in rushed Frank, saying,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run down, Kate! They’re just coming, and I’ve
got to give my hair a brush.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was off again. The visitors, Mrs. Dobson
and Harry, had arrived, and Kate’s hair was flying
wild about her tear-stained face. She flew to the
window, heard her mother on the veranda welcoming
them, and her feet ached to run down, and her tongue
mourned because it could not say one word to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kate, Kate! I say, why don’t you come?” came
from Frank, once more at the door, and then Kate
was alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>She hastened to complete the work she had to do.
Out of the very last corner of the last drawer came
the wished-for ribbon; and as Kate stands there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>before the looking-glass combing her hair, I will tell
you how she appears to me—for I have heretofore forgotten
to describe Kate Hallock. You know that she
is short, because the corn in June and the salt
meadow grass partly concealed her from view. Well,
Kate is brushing her long, fair, shining hair; and as
we look at her profile, she is watching her flushed face
in the glass, and wondering whether or not Harry
Cornwall will know that she has been crying, and—and—would
he laugh at her if he knew what she had
been crying about.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ah! Kate Hallock is laughing at herself now, to
think she could have been so silly; and that laugh
makes her look like herself once more, as she turns
about and quickly catches with her teeth the braid of
her hair, that, thus held, she may tie about it the blue
ribbon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate Hallock has blue, tender eyes; round, soft,
brown cheeks—just such cheeks as the sun and the
wind might be supposed to like to shine upon and
breathe over at any time of the year; teeth small,
sharp, and white—the sun and the wind never tanned
Kate’s teeth; her sweet lips dance over them so constantly
that you never can tell whether you are looking
at the teeth or the lips when she talks or laughs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate’s nose is not quite perfect; if it only were a
mite smaller and straighter, Kate would be a beauty.
However, Kate is the only one who ever finds time or
heart to mourn over that feature of a bright, bonny,
darling young face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now she is ready to go down (and I am sure you
have not yet found out how she looks)—ready, all but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>the tying of her sash. That she manages by a rather
awkward bow, tied in front, and finally jerked and
pulled until the bow is supposed by the child to be in
the back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You look like a guy!” was the accost Frank gave
her as he passed her in the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter, I should like to know, with Mr.
Airy Castle now?” ejaculated Kate. Hearing her
voice, Mrs. Hallock left her guests and went with Kate
back to her own room, where, having examined the
bureau drawers, which were found in order, Mrs.
Hallock tied Kate’s bows anew, kissed her twice, and
sent her down to entertain Mrs. Dobson and Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like to shake hands with you, if I could,”
said Harry, whose right arm was still fast in a sling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, never mind,” said Kate. “Come, I’m in a
hurry to show you something—quick! before Frank
comes!” and Kate hurried Harry off out of doors the
very minute she had told Mrs. Dobson how glad she
was to see her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you know,” said she to Harry (as they
stepped from the veranda), “the morning you first
came here? Well, when you rode past on that ugly
little pony that threw you down and hurt you, I was
just behind that stone wall over there. You can see
it, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry said yes; that he could see it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you must know that my brother Frank has
been taking care of that cornfield ever since for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry wondered what was coming next, but Kate
gave him not the least mite of a chance to ask a question,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>but made haste to say, “That day the corn was
Frank’s, but he ran away. Don’t you remember how
he followed you to the circus grounds and stayed with
you till most dinner time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If he hadn’t,” interposed the lad, “I don’t believe
I should ever have known you, or you me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s just it!” responded Kate. “It makes everything
we do so queer and kind of jumbled up; and
yet,” she said gravely, “everything will come out
right, I s’pose, if we wait long enough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t mean that ’twas right for Frank to run
away, do you?” and Harry looked at Kate out of his
clear, honest, grey eyes, very earnestly indeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see why not, ’cause if he hadn’t, how could
we have known you wanted somebody and a home and
all?” suggested Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, pshaw!” exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like to know if <i>that’s</i> all you’ve got to
say?” said Kate in a decidedly irritated tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg your pardon; I didn’t know how to say what
I wanted to. But don’t you suppose now that if Frank
had stayed in the lot over yonder that morning, and
God—” Harry suddenly stooped, grew red in the face,
stooped and picked up a stone, which he kept tossing
in his left hand as they went along; and he waited
for Kate to speak, which she did presently, saying,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind the rest; you can tell me some other
time. Here we are, close to your cornfield.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like to know why you call it mine,” said
Harry; and then followed the story of Frank’s desire
to earn money for himself, and the opportunity given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>to him by his father, and ingloriously lost by his runaway
propensity, gratified once too often. Kate told
the story with shining eyes, and was particularly careful
to impress upon Harry’s mind the beautiful
manner in which her brother had acted ever since.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry and Kate were standing on the very edge
of the field, and Harry was just saying, “But, Kate, I
cannot take it; you know that I can’t. I should not
enjoy a thing about it,” when a thundering slap struck
upon Harry’s shoulder, and a big, gleesome boy’s voice
shouted close to his ear,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I say, old fellow, how do you like the looks?
Ain’t much like Western corn now, is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank had been advancing cautiously from the rear,
intending to take Kate and Harry by surprise. Harry
was too much hurt by the blow (for Frank had forgotten
his condition) to answer for a minute or two.
In fact he grew so pale that Kate was frightened, and
called Frank “a great rough, cruel fellow, to slap
poor Harry so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I declare, I forgot your arm and everything. I
didn’t mean to hurt you,” explained Frank, and after
a few more sharp twinges in the broken bones, Harry
said,</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is all over and no harm done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Glad to hear you say so,” said Frank. “Now this
don’t look much of a cornfield, I suppose, to you
who’ve seen ever so many acres all in one lot; but
there’s one thing, you may call it ten acres to one—for
that’s about the difference in the price of the corn out
West and here—and when harvest comes, you’ll have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>big pile of heavy ears. Don’t believe I am much of
a born farmer,” added the boy, “or I should have
hung to the main chance a bit longer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sha’n’t take one single ear of your corn, Frank
Hallock,” spoke up Harry. “Pray don’t think I’m
mean enough to touch it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you must,” cried the twins in chorus.
“You’ve got to have it; and,” added Kate, “if you
only knew how hard Frank has worked in the lot since
he knew ’twas yours, and you couldn’t help yourself
lying over there at Mrs. Dobson’s, I know you would.
And you are coming here to live next week, until your
uncle up in Maine, or down in Maine, sends for you,
or comes after you—and, oh, you don’t know how
pretty your room is. Mamma made it so on purpose,
and I helped her, too. Its—” but before Kate had
time to finish the sentence, Harry interrupted her by
saying,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please don’t tell me about it, for, Kate and Frank,
I can’t live at Hallock Point.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry’s statement was so utterly surprising that a
momentary silence followed it, and then the “I should
like to know whys” and the “why nots” overwhelmed
the boy; but when finally Kate burst out
with “I’m sure I don’t see what we have done that
you will neither take Frank’s corn when he gives it to
you, nor come to live with us, when we want to have
you ever so much,” Harry felt compelled to say something,
and what he said was simply this—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to live in Pumpkin Delight Lane, with
Mrs. Dobson.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“Well, now, that is a good joke—going to live with
Grandma Dobson!” laughed Frank; “just as though
you meant what you say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, I do,” Harry replied quite seriously.</p>

<p class='c009'>Practical Kate said: “Why, Harry, don’t you know
that Grandma Dobson is poor—I mean she hasn’t
much money, nothing but the house and the land, I
heard papa say one day; and before her father died
and left the house to her, she used to make dresses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know she’s poor,” and Harry sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, you don’t want to make her poorer, do
you?” Kate asked with an arch look at Harry, for she
evidently thought her final question decided the point.</p>

<p class='c009'>The children had turned and were walking back to
the house. They were come to the spot where Kate
had met the man who was faint and ill, and to whom
she had given Frank’s dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come,” cried Kate, “this is a nice place to sit,
under the shade of these big trees, and we’ll talk
about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Down she went with her fresh white dress on the
green grass; and Harry was, in truth, very glad of the
opportunity of resting, for it was his first walk in over
a month.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, tell us what it all means,” ejaculated Kate,
with her pretty chin resting in the palm of one hand,
and her blue eyes somewhere between the blue of the
sky and Harry’s sober face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it means, if I must tell you, that Mrs. Dobson
talks out loud pretty often. She’s lived alone a good
while, with only Josh in the house; and sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>when I used to lie on my bed still, and maybe she
thought I was fast asleep—I don’t know, though; and
I wonder if folks who live alone don’t always talk to
themselves—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess so,” said Kate. “I’m sure I should have to
talk to somebody—I couldn’t help it; but do hurry
and tell us what she said.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind about the particulars,” put in Frank,
as Harry still hesitated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, what I thought,” began Harry at length,
“was that there was somebody in the room that she
was talking to: for she said that she had lived alone,
waiting and waiting, ever since her mother and father
died, and she meant to wait a good while longer, too,
only it would be so much easier and pleasanter not to
wait all alone; and then she told how lonely ’twas in
the winter when the snows came, and there wasn’t
for a good many days a single track through the snow,
and the ice was so thick on the shore and so strong
in the bay that not one ship could come into the harbor.
And I began to cry when she told about the long dark
nights she had to stay all alone, without one single
human heart—that was just what she said—beating
near her own; and then all at once I knew she was
praying, for she burst out with ‘O, dear Lord, if this
boy you’ve sent to my house could only love me well
enough to live with me just one winter!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate sobbed and Frank whistled, and Harry said,
“What do you s’pose I did then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell!” sighed Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Out with it!” demanded Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“Why, I got up and opened the door softly, and said
I do love you, and I will stay’; and then I shut the
door, but not before I saw that Mrs. Dobson was getting
up from her knees. She hurried into the room
pretty lively, I tell you, and kissed me, and made such
a fuss over me that I came mighty near being sorry
I’d said I would stay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course you’ll stay,” said Kate. “Why I
wouldn’t have you at Hallock Point, not if I could just
as well as not. But what will you do there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, I’ll find enough to do, so that Grandma (she
says I may call her so) won’t think I’m eating her out
of house and home; and then there’s the farm.
Next year who knows what may happen? and as for
this, why there’s a good chance to dig clams between
now and cold weather.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good for you!” cried Frank. “You’re a cracky
chap, after all. Didn’t I see some hens and an old
turkey or two in the back yard the other day, over in
the lane?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Frank, you stupid, you know Grandma Dobson
keeps hens,” said Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They eat corn, like other hens, don’t they?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” laughed Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What then?” questioned Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, that cornfield yonder,” and with the words
Frank walked off, before Kate and Harry had time to
get up from the grass and join him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s just like him,” said Kate, bubbling with
enthusiasm. She was always glad if Frank did or said
the least thing to build up her sisterly pride in him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“It’s so kind of him to remember Grandma Dobson’s
hungry hens. You’ll let <i>her</i> have the corn of course,
Harry!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see how I can help it. If Frank chooses to
give it to her, I’ll promise to gather it, harvest it in
whatever place she chooses to have it, shell it, feed it
out, and save enough for seed next year.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And all this time that the children were talking, the
bright July sun was beaming down on the broad green
leaves of the corn; and that same sun saw another
sight. If the sun had told Frank, Kate, and Harry
what it saw, I do not know what would have happened—something
interesting, I am quite sure; but as
the sun told no tales that day, I will not—until the next
chapter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The letter that Mrs. Hallock sent to “Mr. Horace
Blake, Solon, Maine,” should have been addressed to
Mr. Horace Ludlow, since Uncle Horace was Aunt
Louisa Blake’s husband, and of course had a name of
his own. At the end of three months, Mrs. Hallock
received her letter from the Dead Letter Office.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dear me! if that letter had had the right name on it,
poor Mrs. Dobson would have had to live all alone all
winter, maybe—who knows?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Crooked things <i>do</i> turn out just as straight as anything,
sometimes,” Kate Hallock said, when the letter
was returned to her mother.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_087.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
“Why, Mrs. Dobson, I can’t call you
Grandma any more,” cried Kate Hallock
on the day Frank’s corn was harvested
home.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not, Kittie, my Clover?” replied
the little woman (with a soft tenderness
in her heart that gave a winsome look to
her face) as she glanced upward, for
Mrs. Dobson was busy at work moving
old red and blue chests and things to make room for
the fine yellow ears on the floor of a room where her
father used to spread the corn to dry years and years
before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, because,” replied Kate, “you look too young
and pretty,” she added, “to be Grandma any longer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now, if I ever,” said Mrs. Dobson, but Kate
was down the stairs and away, watching for the first
load to come. She had stayed in the field until it was
half loaded, and she was afraid to stay longer lest it
should get home before she could, and she did want
so to tell all the hens and Grandma that it was coming.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last it drew near. Frank was seated on top,
just where Kate had thought she might take a ride;
but her proposal to mount there had been frowned
down by Frank in the most approved manner of
brothers to sisters. Harry Cornwall was walking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>beside the sober old horse, who without doubt kept up
a wondering as to what barn his master owned down
that lane, since he had never drawn corn there before.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next load of corn Kate did have the pleasure of
taking a ride on, for her father not only gave permission,
but lifted her to a seat on a board laid across it,
and Kate enjoyed her bit of victory over Frank, to her
heart’s content.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the harvest came many frosts, then dear,
beautiful, Indian Summer, which Kate said was just
like a whole summerful of days, sweetened and cooked
hard, and then November skies and November leaden
everywhere; the first snow that didn’t amount to
much—Thanksgiving that did, and then winter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry went to school, cut the fire wood, made the
fire (Grandma Dobson kept but one fire in her house,
except on grand occasions), fed the hens, drew water
from the well, went for milk, and everything else that
was needed in the brown house in the Lane; and, on
Sundays, now that Mrs. Dobson had company, she did
not so much mind the long walk to the old First
church, even if “the going” was icy and bad, for, as
the dear little woman quietly expressed the matter to
herself in thought, she did get so much comfort and
nearness to something human, in having Harry in the
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>One night, when the moonlight was shining very
bright, and Harry thought that he had been sleeping
a long time, he awoke suddenly, and lay wondering
what he had waked up for, when he heard a sound just
outside his door. “It’s a mouse trying to get into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>corn room,” he said; but not feeling altogether satisfied,
he got out of bed and carefully opened his door
just in time to see a shadow steal across the moonlight
on the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s there?” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, ’tisn’t a thief; it’s only me,” said Mrs. Dobson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matter?” questioned Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing at all, Harry; only I didn’t feel like going
to bed very early, but now I’m going,” and he heard
every step on the stairs, and also the sound of the latch
on the door as she went into her own room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Mrs. Dobson would not have told Harry, “for
anything,” what I tell you. She had been reading
over just three, old-time, yellow letters, and reading
them had made her feel so lonely that she had gone
up to Harry’s door to listen a moment to his deep
breathing in his sleep, just to feel <i>sure</i> that she was
not, as she had been for so many years, all alone in
the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry Cornwall had grown very dear to Mrs. Dobson
before Christmas time; and, if I must tell all the
truth, the lad had grown “pretty dear” to a number of
people beside; Frank Hallock thought him “just the
jolliest, grandest, pokiest, saint-of-a-fellow,” he told
Kate, one day in the week before Christmas, when
Frank slyly suspected that Kate was making something
for a present for himself, and tried to make her
think that he thought it was for Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Christmas morning Mrs. Hallock sent to ask Mrs.
Dobson if she could spare Harry to her for an hour
or two.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Mrs. Dobson could not help thinking that it was
a little bit queer that Harry should be sent for on that
morning of all others, but she said “Yes—most certainly—to
be sure,” and off Harry went to drive with
Frank down to the huts on Peconick Point, with gifts
of turkeys, sugar, and tea, to persons living there.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been gone about half an hour when a queer
looking wagon came “wheeling” down the lane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me! I wonder who is moving, this cold
weather. Christmas day, too,” sighed Mrs. Dobson,
as she looked out and saw it going past. Josh was
enjoying his morning nap behind the stove, but a
minute after up went his long ears, and out came a
bark so loud and quick and deep that it made the little
woman jump.</p>

<p class='c009'>A knock on the door, and in came Hugo.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Christmas!” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wish you many merry Christmases,” said Mrs.
Dobson, looking up in surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In dem wagin out doors,” said Hugo. “Mad-am
Hallock she be coming by soon,” and without another
word Hugo walked out again and presently reappeared
with the headboard of a bedstead in his arms. It was
very bright blue, and most charmingly designed and
painted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Grandma Dobson could only look on in silent
wonder as he put it down and walked off again to
fetch another part.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time Mrs. Hallock came upon the scene,
Hugo had transferred a complete set of bedroom
furniture to Mrs. Dobson’s kitchen—that is, all but
one piece.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>While the amazed little woman stood looking at it
and wondering in her heart what it all could mean,
with a bang and a thump on the back door, appeared
a rocking chair, and Kate Hallock’s blue eyes peeping
through the cane holes in the back of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate half stumbled into the room behind her burden,
and before Mrs. Dobson really had time to hurry forward
and help, Kate had put the pretty blue rocking
chair right in the middle of the kitchen. The next
thing that she did was to walk up to Mrs. Dobson, seize
her in her two arms and push her right into the blue
rocking chair, saying, “There! you belong in that
whenever you are tired, or are not tired either.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kittie-my-Christmas Clover!” was all that Mrs.
Dobson could say, and then the foolish woman made
a motion just as though she was going to pick up the
corner of her blue-checked apron (which just matched
the chair, Kate thought), but before she had time,
Kate had been at her own pocket and tossed a nice
fine handkerchief into Mrs. Dobson’s lap, so that her
hand fell upon that when she was about to catch up the
corner of the apron.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What next?” and Mrs. Dobson’s coming tears
hastened into a little laugh. “I’m afraid you’re going
to spoil me,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Mrs. Dobson, you didn’t think, did you, that
all these things, this bedroom set, was for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what could I think, I should like to know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m so sorry, if you are sorry about it too,” said
Kate. “But you see, when mamma thought Harry
was coming to live at our house, she fitted up a room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>on purpose, and bought this furniture to put in it; but
now, as he is going to live here, and nobody ever uses
that room, and he wouldn’t take the corn, you know,
and everybody says he is such a good boy, why papa
and mamma said he might have it, and so Frank and
I give it to him. Dear me, what a long talk that
was!” and Kate dropped half exhausted into one of
the chairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I’m ever so much happier than I should be to
have it all mine,” said Mrs. Dobson, “and when I saw
how pretty your room looked, it made me sorry for
Harry, for his chamber upstairs does look dreary
enough—only I try to keep it clean for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then Mrs. Hallock arrived, with many apologies
to Mrs. Dobson for not sending her word before, and
said she had come to help arrange the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it is very cold up there,” said Mrs. Dobson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’ll be such good fun to make a fire on the hearth,”
said Kate, and she did enjoy every bit of the labor of
making that fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hugo carried up the new furniture, and carried out
the old. The bed did look a little bit lost in its new
frame, but Mrs. Hallock said that could easily be made
all right. They had worked very fast for fear that
Harry would get home before it was all done, and Kate
was just spreading two fresh, home-made towels on
the new towel rack, when in came Frank and Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Grandma!” said Harry, for she was downstairs,
“I’m sure I saw smoke in the front chimney as we
came up the lane.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shouldn’t wonder one mite—it’s Christmas, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“Why didn’t you tell me, and let me build the fire
before I went?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry opened the door into one of the front rooms;
there was no sign of fire on the hearth. His room
was just above it; he heard a mysterious tread.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is up in my room?” he cried, and rushed up,
to witness the presence of Mrs. Hallock, Kate, and the
transformation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can’t get rid of taking corn this time, when
St. Nicholas sends it to you!” cried Kate, positively
trembling with excitement. She was excited by
giving, and also at the effect of her gift.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t I go, too?” asked Frank of Mrs. Dobson.
“I had the hardest work to keep him from thinking
the house was on fire, and made believe I didn’t see
any smoke. My! how the folks did snivel down on
the Point when they saw the turkeys and things. I
don’t see why women always will cry and make such
a fuss when they’re glad a bit. Did you say I might
go?”—edging toward the stairway.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes, Frank.” Mrs. Dobson was busy just
then peeping into her oven. She had had hard work
to get her new chair covered up in time, so that Harry
should not see it as he entered the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank tried to step softly, but his boots had been
wet, and they creaked so that it was of no use; so he
gave it up, and walked into Harry’s room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Halloa, old fellow! What’s happened here? Most
got your wings on, haven’t you? Real butterfly
colors, too—blue and yellow! I declare you look well
in them,” throwing himself into one of the chairs that
had been placed invitingly before the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>As for poor Harry, he looked more sorry than glad;
and the only words he said, when he began to realize
that the furniture was his own, were:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish my mother could have had them—she did
love pretty things so!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t she have them?” asked Kate impulsively.
“I thought you said your mother was a lady once?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, she was,” said Harry; “but my father hadn’t
money to buy her pretty things with.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too bad, wasn’t it, mamma? What would you do
without pretty things?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should love you, Kate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I’m pretty, <i>folks say</i>,” said Kate archly; and
then Harry and Frank couldn’t help laughing at Kate,
and everybody felt better for that little laugh. And
the Hallocks hurried home; for the brothers and
sisters who were married, and had homes of their own,
were come to spend Christmas at the house on the
Point, and there was to be a grand Christmas dinner
that day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Dobson and Harry sat down to eat their
Christmas dinner; while Josh looked on, quite certain
that his own dinner would come soon after.</p>

<p class='c009'>After Christmas the winter wore away very rapidly,
and in April Harry Cornwall began his life as a
farmer. Mrs. Dobson owned about sixteen acres of
land, and with the aid of her trusty helper, Harry, she
resolved to till it once more, although all the old
farmers shook their heads disapprovingly, and said
she had much better let it out “on shares”; but Mrs.
Dobson had found that her side of the “shares” was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>always very small, and that the land was getting terribly
run down, as they grew smaller year by year.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry did not fancy the life of a farmer, but he
loved Mrs. Dobson so well that he was fully determined
to do the best he could, for her sake; and he
helped with the plowing, and the planting he did with
his own hands, following with shrewdness, not the
advice of the farmers, but their own example in
regard to the time of planting and the manner of
planting: for he noticed that, like other men, their
professions and their practice seldom agreed. And
so, when, one night, his field for planting corn was all
in readiness for work on the morrow, and a neighbor
came, and leaning over the fence, said, “It isn’t time
to put in corn yet for a week or ten days, my boy,”
“my boy” watched, and seeing the next morning his
adviser go down the lane with bags of something very
like corn in his cart, he came to the conclusion that he
was going to put in his seed that day, and planted
his own.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank Hallock made many promises to help on this
day or that, but something was sure to happen, and
so well-meaning but unstable Frank was almost
certain to be absent at the appointed time.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Kate, she took the liveliest interest in farming
occupations both at home and abroad, and just as
certain as she saw anything coming up at the Point,
whether it was potatoes, beans, corn, or any other
green thing, she would within a day or two contrive
a drive or a walk down Pumpkin Delight Lane to the
sea, to see if anything that looked like it was coming
out of the ground in Harry’s brown fields.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>One day Frank got vexed because he could not have
Neptune when he wanted to drive on the beach, and
somehow it would be impossible to tell just how it did
grow—but that little cloud of vexation, instead of
clearing, grew until Kate was thoroughly out of
patience with Frank. He became morose, and didn’t
want to go to school.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank don’t feel well,” Mrs. Hallock said to her
husband on one of the warmest days in June, “and I
think we may as well let him leave school.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, mamma!” said Kate, “Frank is so far behind
now; I don’t see how he can ever catch up in this
world, if he leaves school. He will get behind me in
everything, and then when he goes again in the fall
he won’t be in my classes at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My head aches!” said Frank; “it aches the whole
time,” and so Frank was given leave to begin his
summer vacation in June; but being out of school did
not help the matter one bit; it only grew worse, until
Frank became so thoroughly cross and fretful that
nothing pleased him. His clothes weren’t fit to wear.
Other boys whose fathers weren’t one bit richer than
his, according to Frank’s version, had better suits than
he had, and it was mean, downright mean, to make
him dress so shabby. Neptune was a slow-go kind of
a horse; getting old, too, and had an ugly way of
stopping, just like a doctor’s horse, at every door-yard
gate. Father was mean; mother didn’t love him half
as much as she did Kate; and, as for Kate, <i>he</i> was
nowhere since that Dobson boy, Harry Cornwall, had
come; Kate was growing homely, too, getting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>freckled, and was getting as—well—anyhow she
acted just like a boy, and boy-girls were his abomination.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Kate heard him give utterance to the turn of
his grievances, and he came to the final one, she
retorted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor, little girl-boy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank struck her on the cheek so sharply that when
Kate appeared at the tea table her finger-marked
cheek caused her father to ask what it meant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, not much,” said Kate, with a glance at Frank
as much as to ask, “What <i>shall</i> I say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me what made the mark on your cheek,” said
Mr. Hallock with such sternness that Kate felt the
words jerked out of her, as she said, “Frank’s fingers,
papa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank’s fingers, indeed,” ejaculated Mr. Hallock.
“Tell me, sir, what you meant by striking your sister?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She called me a girl-boy,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He called me a boy-girl first, papa, and I didn’t
strike him for it,”—Kate could not resist saying so
much in her own favor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was dismissed from the table and sent to his
own room, there to stay and live upon bread and water
until he could beg Kate’s pardon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want him to beg my pardon,” said Kate,
“and I don’t want him shut up, either,” and Kate was
following her poor, persecuted brother out of the
room to share his isolated condition, when she was
sternly bidden to return “and not go near Frank again
to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“It is very queer that I can never punish Frank
without you taking it into your head to be punished,
too,” said Mr. Hallock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, papa, I can’t help it. I love him so much,
and I’m so sorry for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ought to love him well enough to wish to have
him reform,” said her father; and then the tea went
on just as though Frank had not been dismissed in disgrace—only
it did not.</p>

<p class='c009'>After tea, as Kate could not go near Frank, she
went around into Pumpkin Delight Lane and told
Grandma Dobson all about it, and the dear little
woman sympathized with her exceedingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning Frank was not at breakfast.
Mrs. Hallock went with her husband on an early train
to New York, and Kate found that Frank was locked
into his room for all day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anyhow,” she said, “I’m not forbidden to speak
to him to-day,” so she went up to his door and said,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good morning, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>No answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good morning, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You didn’t care to say good night,” said Frank in
a very gruff voice mingled with a good deal of rattling
at the lock of the door from the inside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank, you know I couldn’t. Papa told me not
to speak to you last night; but Grandma Dobson is
real sorry for you. She gave me some seed cakes.
Want one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! not for breakfast. I say, what did you have
downstairs?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“I haven’t been to breakfast yet, but I know there
is griddle cakes. I smell them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fetch me some.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wish I could.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do it then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The door is locked. Can’t put them through the
keyhole.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The window isn’t locked. Toss them up. I’ll
catch, first-rate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somebody’ll tell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who cares after I’ve eaten ’em?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll try,” and Kate ran down to eat her own breakfast.
It was lonely at the table. The cakes choked
her. She couldn’t eat. She buttered and sugared a
plateful for Frank, tossed up one or two, but the
window was too high, and the cakes fell on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know a way,” she shouted, and presently Kate
appeared on the staircase with the plate of cakes in
one hand and a broom in the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few minutes later Frank heard a voice that
seemed to come out of the sky; at any rate it came in
at his window, saying,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, Frank, here’s your cakes,” and Kate reached
out from the window next to Frank’s the handle of
the broom, around which she had tied the cakes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank took in the broom, saying,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jolly for you! Is this all you can get?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess there’s more. I’ll see,” and away went
Kate to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Laws me!” said the cook, “who wants cakes?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“O, Frank and I want some more,” said Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your mother gave me orders, Miss Kate, and I’m
not to give Master Frank anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well; give me some, then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate carried the cakes to the table, prepared them
for eating, and then conveyed them on the broom handle
to Frank, who received them gladly, not knowing
that Kate had made one more little sacrifice—and
more than a sacrifice—for his sake.</p>

Kate Hallock was drawing near to
Mrs. Dobson’s house in the lane. “Dear
grandma!” she called, “I’m just perishing
with hunger! I’m starved nearly to
death! I’ve had no breakfast yet! Will
you give me a piece of your rye bread and
butter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The dear old lady’s curls were bound
about with a muslin kerchief, for it was
her morning for churning, and the stone jar, with its
little wooden dasher, was waiting her hands when
Kate’s plaint broke upon her hearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hungry! starving! no breakfast! What does it
mean, Kittie Clover?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It means,” said Kate, “that I gave my breakfast
to a poor fellow who had none, or next to none, nothing
but plain bread.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Plain bread is good, Kittie; quite good enough for
tramps. Do you suppose that the tramp would give
up his breakfast for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wasn’t a tramp, Grandma Dobson.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please don’t ask me another word. O, I am so
hungry. Will you let me help myself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit right down here, poor child, and eat all you
want.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Kate seated herself beside the pine table, scrubbed to
its best estate of cleanliness, and Mrs. Dobson placed
upon it a whole loaf of bread, a three-pound roll of
butter, and a four-quart pan of milk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell all the tramps I meet where to come,” said
Kate laughing, as she proceeded to cut the loaf.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Josh knows a tramp the instant he sees one,” said
Mrs. Dobson, “and I always have to feed them outside
the gate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is Josh this morning, grandma?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He has gone down to the shore with Harry; it’s
most time for them to get back now. We will have
the clams they fetch home for dinner, if you will stay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is my dinner and breakfast together, thank
you,” said Kate. “Besides, I must hurry home; for
father and mother have gone away to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And where is Frank? I haven’t seen him in a
long time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, he is at home,” said Kate carelessly; “only,”
she added, “I don’t think he feels very well nowadays”;
and then Kate, to give Mrs. Dobson no opportunity
to ask a question, began to put away the large
remains of her feast, and to return her very expressive
thanks for the same. “Now, Grandma Dobson,
it isn’t one bit polite, I know, to eat and run away;
but kiss me, and I’ll go home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“See here, Kittie Clover, something is the matter
at home, and you will not tell me. However, I will
kiss you, and when you are ready, come and tell me
all about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some time you shall know every single thing,”
said Kate—more than half persuaded to tell it all out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>on the instant; but she did not, for her quick hearing
caught the sound of coming, made by Josh, in the
lane.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate hurried away. She wished to see Harry, and
to urge him to find time to go and talk to Frank.
Kate herself, after breakfast, had begged her brother
to ask her forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not the least objection to doing it, Kate—do
forgive me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know I did long ago, Frank. How I wish
father and mother were here now—then you could
come right out! you’ll—ask me—won’t you?—when
they come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think I will, Kate,” Frank had said; and
poor Kate had run away around the corner in bitter
disappointment.</p>

<p class='c009'>After thinking the matter over, she had come to the
conclusion that if anybody could persuade her brother
to do right, Harry Cornwall could; and to him she
had come.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry heard the story, and promised to be over
some time in the afternoon. Kate went home rejoicing
all the way, very certain now that the trouble
would soon be over. She had not been long at home
when Frank called to her that he wanted something
to read.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fetch me <cite>Young Folks</cite>,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>That magazine had been received the evening
before. Kate was herself in the midst of a most
entertaining story at the instant the call came. She
went to the window adjoining Frank’s.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“Bub!” she said softly. Kate never called Frank
“Bub” except in a tone of endearment.</p>

<p class='c009'>He put his head out from the open window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here I am, Kate. I’ll catch it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m just reading the loveliest story, Frank! I’ll be
through in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want it now. I’ve called you a hundred times
since breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank,” said Kate, “if I give this to you now,
will you please ask my forgiveness just as soon as
they get home. If you will, you shall have it, right
away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give it to me quick, Kate. It’s as much my magazine
as ’tis yours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it is just as much mine as ’tis yours, too,
Master Frank, and I won’t give it to you, unless you
will promise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep it then, and see what you will get for it,”
returned Frank, dropping the window-sash heavily to
close further negotiations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate’s eyes grew dim with tears. Here she was,
after trying so hard to conciliate her brother, at open
variance with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>She returned to her seat, opened the orange-tinted
covers, sought out the place where she had left off
reading, and tried to recover interest in the story, but
in vain. There, right beyond the wall of her room,
was her brother, and he was angry at her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Foolish Kate! She closed the <cite>Young Folks</cite>, trod
softly to Frank’s door and whispered through the keyhole,
“Here is the magazine. You may have it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>No response.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“Frank! open the window and I’ll give you <cite>Young
Folks</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, won’t you please take it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do! why won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t want it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, Harry Cornwall is coming to see you some
time this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who said so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He told me so himself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t see him. Tell him, when he comes, that
I’ve gone away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell a lie, Frank!” ejaculated Kate. “I won’t do
it, not even for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell him just what you’ve a mind to, then. I don’t
care what you tell him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have told him all about it,” cried Kate, “and I
just wish you were like Harry. He is never cross and
unkind to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know you like him ever so much more than you
do me. I dare say you wish I was dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank! Frank!” cried Kate, and for a long
time Frank heard her sobbing at the door, and then all
was still.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dinner-bell rang just as usual.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate went down to her solitary dinner. There was
but one plate laid at the table, and after a few minutes,
Sallie, the little maid, placed the bell by her side, and
left the room. This was the opportunity sought by
Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>It took but a minute or two to secrete food enough
from the table for Frank; having done which, Kate
sat demurely at the dinner until a reasonable time was
past, before summoning Sallie. This time she was
able to secure a basket, and to rap at Frank’s window
and pass it in to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There was only one plate of pudding,” she said,
“and that I’ve put in the basket for you; but there’s
a good lot of hard sauce on it—cook knows I like hard
sauce.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kate,” said Frank from the window a few minutes
later, “you are a brick!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank! you know mamma can’t bear to hear
you talk that way; please don’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dare say she wouldn’t bear to have you fetch me,
on a broom handle, this jolly good dinner. Wish you
knew how good it tastes to a fellow shut up all day.
I say, Sis, help a fellow out awhile this afternoon.
Fetch the light ladder; it will reach to the lower
window-cap, and I can let myself down by holding
fast to the blind. Do now, and I’ll see Harry if you
will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>How nice it seemed to hear Frank talk to her again,
and to be called “Sis” by him, and to know that he
depended on her! O, how Kate Hallock did long to
run and fetch the light ladder and let him down!—but
she knew she ought not to do it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, now—there’s a good Sis.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank Hallock, you know better! I’m ashamed of
you!” cried a breezy voice from under the window—and
there was Harry Cornwall!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Kate drew her head in quickly, and disappeared
from sight and sound; while Frank glowered down at
Harry’s earnest face, upturned to meet his angry stare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank,” said Harry after a moment’s peering cautiously
about, lest he be overheard—“now, Frank,
neither you nor I think well of a coward, do we?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who calls <i>me</i> a coward?” retorted Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank Hallock will call himself one if he will see
himself as others see him. I overheard you asking
Kate to fetch you a ladder for you to climb down on,
when you know perfectly well that she ought not to
do it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who cares for your ought-nots? Go home—get
off these premises!” cried Frank, trembling with
rage, and hurling down at Harry the plate that had
recently held the pudding.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry dodged, and the plate fell, apparently
unharmed, upon the grass. Harry picked it up, and
walked away with it in his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank Hallock, you’re just the meanest boy alive,
and I do wish you were not my brother!” were the
next words that reached Frank; and then all was
silence and stillness in and about the house until the
nearing wheels were heard that brought home Mr.
and Mrs. Hallock.</p>

<p class='c009'>All day long their hours had been saddened by recollections
of Frank in his disobedience and his punishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor fellow! he will be very willing to ask Kate’s
pardon to-night,” said his mother as they drew near
home.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“I hope we have been wise in our decision,” said
Mr. Hallock, for, that day, they had determined to
send Frank to a boarding school in New Haven.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate was rejoiced to see her father and mother
again. Her flash of anger against Frank was all
gone, and she was eager for the moment of reconciliation
to arrive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, Kate,” said Mr. Hallock, “here is the key.
Go and liberate your brother and tell him to come
to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate ran up joyously, a candle in one hand, the key
in the other. The key she thrust in at the place,
turned it with a jerk, and the door flew back. “Come,
Frank! Come, Bub! Papa is waiting for you, and
there is all sorts of good things, an out and out feast
for supper, to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank sat moodily by the window, unstirring and
speechless.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate went near him—“Dear Frank,” she said, “I’m
real sorry I said that, about wishing you wasn’t my
brother—I’m ever so glad that you are—won’t you
forgive me, Frank? Come down, do!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank never moved.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate kissed his cheek—the very ear part of it, was
all that she could touch.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank never stirred.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hallock, listening, had heard Kate’s words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank!” he called.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir!” responded Frank, never turning his face
from the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you are willing to ask your sister’s pardon,
come down!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“O, Frank, Frank, do come,” pleaded Kate in his
ear, in the sweetest, tenderest of whispers, but Frank
gave no response.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hallock entered the room, led Kate away, and
locked the door again.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
As the darkness grew into the room where
Frank Hallock was prisoned, the boy’s
misery grew around his heart. Over and
over to himself he said: “I am sorry I
struck Kate; but I won’t tell father and
mother I’m sorry—not if I have to stay
here forever! They are always praising
Kate, and they think everything she does
is just right, and everything I do is as
horrid as horrid can be—and it isn’t fair one bit.
Kate has a real good time, and I never can do anything
I want to. Father and mother love Kate a great deal
more than they do me. Besides, I’m fourteen and
over—big enough to take care of myself, without
somebody to tell me every single thing I must do or
mustn’t do; and I won’t stand it! Lots and lots of
boys run away from home in story books, and have
capital, good, jolly times. I’ve a great mind to run
away myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same time in which Frank was thinking these
thoughts, he heard distinctly the voice of conscience
telling him that his father and mother were right; that
the best and only just thing for him to do was the
very thing they desired him to do. And far louder
and deeper than the wicked suggestion concerning the
absence of love, came the ringing assurance, through
all the days and nights that he could remember, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>unnumbered, untellable acts of love. Poor Frank, the
good and the evil were striving for the mastery of
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sitting thus, and pondering the possibilities of running
away from home—the home that he, for the
moment, persuaded himself that he detested—there
came to him a few trembling tones of sound from
below. He knew that tea was over, and that Kate was
at the piano. He could see the evening lamp on the
table, and his father and mother sitting in the room.
Yes, then it came—the song of thanks and praise for
all the blessings of the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the stillness that followed, Frank knew perfectly
well what was going on down there. If he ran away,
why he might never again hear Kate play his favorite
music—never hear his father pray; and just here
Frank began to wonder if the supper table was cleared
away, if the good things Kate had referred to were
all eaten up, if they really intended to leave him go
supperless to bed. He had not heard a sound of
approach to his door when there came through the
keyhole a stifled “Bub!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He answered it with “Fetch me some supper,
Kate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t, Frank; they won’t let me. Mother is coming
in a minute with some bread, and be good. <i>Do</i>,
Frank—for they’re going to send you to General
Russell’s School; you’ll wear a uniform, and everything!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank’s heart beat proudly for a moment. The
desire of his life was about to be gratified then. In an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>instant all of the ill feeling that had hardened him
seemed to be as though it had not been.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll say it, Kate,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was going to be good again. Away fled
Kate to her mother, saying,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t you hurry, mamma, with Frank’s supper?
I know he must be hungry by this time, and please
let me help you to carry it to him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If Frank would only do what he ought to do, he
might come down and get his supper,” sighed Mrs.
Hallock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Try him, just once, mamma, and see,” urged Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come with me, then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank,” called Mrs. Hallock, “are you ready to
ask your sister’s forgiveness?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am,” shouted Frank in the most amiable
of moods.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was set free, marched down stairs and into his
father’s presence, where, without the slightest hesitation,
he made the required apology.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate kissed him for answer. As she did so, she
turned suddenly very red in the face and nearly
bit her lip through with the quick effort she made to
suppress a scream; for Frank slyly caught a bit of her
arm between his fingers and pinched it cruelly. The
tears filled her eyelids, and she ran away quickly to
hide all sign of her hurt.</p>

<p class='c009'>The same night, by the light of the moon, Kate saw
Frank standing beside her bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I pinch you much?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Awfully, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“You were first-rate not to tell of a fellow by
making a fuss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you were meaner than anybody I ever
thought of; after I had been so good to you all day
and everything.” Kate could not help saying this.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll just tell you what ’tis, Kate, you are a great
deal better to me than you ought to be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sha’n’t be sorry, Frank, when you are away at
school, that I was kind to you when you were at home;
besides, Harry Cornwall told me something to-day that
I never thought about before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hate Harry Cornwall, Kate!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate made no sign of having heard the words.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank went on to say, “And I just wish that you
would never speak to me of him again. I dare say he
is putting you up to all sorts of disagreeable things
on my account.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate made no response for a moment, and then she
said, the moonlight in the room making her pale face
quite radiant as she spoke, “I wonder, Frank, what
Jesus Christ would tell me to say to you, if he were
here now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good night, Kate; I’m going,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bub, won’t you kiss me without a pinch?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I will, Kate, and I don’t really and truly
hate Harry as much as I made out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad to hear you say so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Kate, I am just the least mite curious to
know what the fellow did say to you to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sha’n’t tell you, because you call him a fellow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saint, then, Kate; will that do?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“It’s nearer the truth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell, then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, not to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I don’t give the kiss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good night, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good night, Kate; you’ll be awful sorry, when I’m
gone to school.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank went to his own room, and to sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate wished with all her heart it was morning. She
could not go to sleep, and it was so dismal to lie there
thinking about Frank’s going away from home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hallock Point without Frank Hallock, Kate did not
think could be a home at all, and just there, Kate
began to wonder why she could not go to boarding
school quite as well as Frank. Certainly she was as
old, and as for progress in school, she was far in
advance of her brother. Besides, it would be, O, so
nice, to think of it! Frank at General Russell’s, and she
at school in New Haven, too. Frank would come and
visit her in his gay uniform, and how proud she would
be of her handsome brother, only Kate did hope he
would not pinch or slap her before the other girls.
And then Kate looked around her pretty room, with
its adornments, each and every one with its little history
of birthday gift, Christmas greeting, or token of
love; and then suddenly she saw it all—her room without
herself in it, Frank’s room vacant; no merry shout
or sound of boyish presence—no Kate, even. Then it
was that Kate thought, “No, it shall not be. Poor
mamma! it would be too, too bad. I will not say one
word about going to school,” and she went to sleep,
at last, strong in the determination.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>The next day the good news was announced to
Frank in formal manner. His parents thought their
son received the intelligence very quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my son,” said Mr. Hallock, “if you are to
go to school in September, the weeks that lie between
are not to be devoted exclusively to play. You are
to fit yourself to enter certain classes in the school,
and you are to have a master every day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How pokey, to study in summer, papa!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he will teach Kate, as well. If he takes the
trouble to come here every day from the village, he
may as well have two pupils as one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, papa,” suggested Kate, “why not three, as
well as two? There is Harry, and you know how he
has had to stay out of school with the plowing and the
planting and the hoeing, and all sorts of things, and
now he could get time just as well as not to run over
for his lessons; and papa,” she added slyly, whispering
the words in at his ear so that Frank might not
hear, “Frank would have to study then, ’cause he
would be ashamed to have Harry get ahead, a poor
circus boy, you know!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Kate, I do not know; but we will see about
Harry afterward.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The master was from the village. Captain Green
was his name. He had taught school for forty years
in the winter, and been a pupil of the sea during the
summer for a still longer period. The villagers used
to say that every billow sweeping the Sound had felt
the stroke of his oar. He was out on the bay at early
morn, and the last ray of light found him urging on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>his little craft at night. He trapped lobsters, caught
crabs, dug clams, sat for hours together holding the
line over the edge of his boat that rocked idly on
summer seas, in the hope of catching a black fish a
little larger than any other fisherman had caught; and
perfectly delighted to spend his nights in throwing out
and drawing in the long seines, in the hope of the
heaviest haul of bass or bluefish that ever came to
shore. This was the master, Captain Green, who
proposed to spend two hours every day at Hallock
Point. He could run down the harbor to the Point,
tie up his boat, and then, after lessons, go outside.</p>

<p class='c009'>The villagers heard the news with unbelieving ears.
“No power on earth,” they said, “could keep Captain
Green on shore for two hours a day, so long as he
could move an oar.” Nevertheless, Captain Green
appeared prompt to the moment at the appointed hour.</p>

School began in the tower room of the
house at Hallock Point. Harry Cornwall
went to the lessons because he eagerly
sought knowledge. Kate Hallock tried to
study because she wished to win the good
opinion of Frank, and, if possible, to excel
him in everything. Frank went because,
as he said, “he had to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Green taught in order to obtain
for a well-beloved little grandson, whose days on the
earth were to be few in number, the nameless, numberless
little helps-by-the-way to the place of parting.</p>

<p class='c009'>Had Mrs. Hallock known what the love for the sea
meant to Captain Green, instead of giving up the
tower room for lessons, she would have chosen the
spot in the house the most remote from sight or sound
of wave; but there he was, day by day, with the blue
of dancing, sun-lit water beckoning to him. He could
see the gentle glide of every keel that went down the
harbor, and feel the drawing of every sail that filled
away under the sweet pressure of the summer winds.
More than any schoolboy that ever groaned to play
truant did Captain Green feel the impulse to run away
from school; nevertheless, he remained faithful to his
trust, and for two August weeks everything went well
with the new enterprise. Mrs. Dobson was perfectly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>gleeful over the grand opportunity afforded Harry.
She thought early and late, and worked all the day
between the thinkings, to give Harry every moment
that was possible. The dear little soul knew perfectly
well that the more Harry learned, the less the chance
of keeping him in Pumpkin Delight Lane; but the
more she loved her boy, the less grew her selfishness,
and the more she rejoiced in whatever of good came
to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the shore there lay an old wreck, from which
Harry wrenched a few planks. By the aid of Frank
Hallock, on the Saturday before school began, he got
them to the marsh that lay between the Point and the
lane, and placed them along the line of danger. Thus
Harry made short work of getting to and from the
tower room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Josh was for a few days greatly disturbed by the
new order of going and coming, and followed Harry
across field and marsh until Captain Green shook out
on the air the tongue of his bell, whereat the dog gave
forth a recitation in a howl, and went home, only to
repeat the same on the day following.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the little island, lying off shore from the town,
there was a mill for the making of oil from white fish.
At the time the school began on the Point, business at
the oil mill was very good. Dozens of boats sailed
up to the wharf at evening, with loads of sparkling,
rainbow-hued menhaden, that had been trapped into
nets during the day, in the deep waters of the Sound.
Far into the night, and sometimes until the day-dawn
came, men would work at unloading the fish, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>were thrown into tubs, the tubs hoisted by steam to
a car, into which they were dumped, until the thousands
filled it. In its turn the car was drawn up the
long lines of rail leading from the wharf to the upper
story of the mill.</p>

<p class='c009'>This mill was within sight from the room where
Frank studied, and by the aid of a spy glass could be
seen distinctly, although lying two miles away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every morning early, when the wind and weather
served, the schoolmaster went across to the island
wharf to procure bait for his lobster pots. Occasionally
when a fog dropped suddenly down, or the
wind blew fast from off shore, Captain Green was late
in returning from the lobster pound, and the spy glass
was used in the tower to find out his whereabouts.</p>

<p class='c009'>One morning Captain Green was caught in a fog
when returning to the mainland: the three scholars
waited in the schoolroom, and he did not return.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is just nice for you, Frank,” said Kate, “that
he does not come, for now you have time to learn the
lessons you did not get last night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No lessons until to-morrow,” said Frank. “There
is no use studying. Captain Green can never find his
way in in this fog, for just before it shut down I saw
him off to the east of the island; shouldn’t wonder a
bit if the New Haven steamboat ran him down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank Hallock!” cried Kate, “you speak just as
though you’d be rather glad of it if something did
happen to the Captain. You ought to be ashamed of
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not, pray? I hate this study, study all the
time. What’s the good of it, anyhow? I don’t want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>to be what folks call a scholarly man. I’d a great deal
rather be a sailor—wish I was out now in this fog.
It’s capital jolly getting lost in fogs, and the first you
know coming up to land somewhere, and not knowing
where in the world you’ve got to. I often think, Kate,
I’ll run away and go to sea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank!” and Kate dropped her book and flew
to Frank’s chair, and putting her arms about his neck,
began to cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a little goose you are, Kate,” said Frank.
“I wonder if you think a few tears will keep me at
home, when I’ve made up my mind to set sail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate assumed a vast amount of dignity on the
instant, and in quite a stately manner for Kate Hallock,
groped her way, with eyes foggy with tears, from
the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t fall down stairs!” shouted Frank after her.
And then Harry Cornwall for the first time looked up
from his slate, upon which he was working out the
examples of the lesson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank,” said he, “if I had a sister I don’t think
I’d take such delight in teasing her as you do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, yes, you would. You’d never find out without
it whether she loved you or not. Why, it’s just fun
to see Kate’s great eyes when the tears are getting
together in them. Kate’s tears are always close to
her eyes; mine are clear down in my boots, and I’m
glad of it; besides, Harry, I’m most ready to be off to
sea. I’ll tell you something. There’s a right jolly
good fellow working over in the oil mill at the island.
His name is Victor—Victor what, I don’t know, for he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>won’t tell—and he ran away from home in Germany
more than two years ago. His folks don’t know
where he is. I think it would be good fun not to have
it known where I went to or anything. Victor is as
jolly as a regular tar: he has the nicest eyes, blue as
can be, and the whitest teeth—white as a shark’s; and
he says his father is rich, and his mother rides in her
own carriage, and everything is in hoity-toity good
shape at home. Some day, he says, he will write
home, when he gets tired of working in the mill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe in your Victor, Frank. Look here,
now: would you, Frank Hallock, leave your home,
and go to work in that oil mill?” questioned Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, that is different. Maybe if I was off in Germany,
and couldn’t get anything else to do, and must
earn my bread some way, I should go into most any
kind of a mill; but the fishing part I wouldn’t mind
one bit. I wonder what has become of Kate?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank,” said Harry, “I’ve wanted to say something
to you for a good many days now, but I hadn’t
the courage. I thought it would be a right good time
that Saturday when we laid planks across the marsh,
but somehow every plank we got up from the beach
made it harder, and I was a coward after all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Out with it now, then; it’s foggy enough to hide
your blushes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s something you will not like to hear, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Out with it, I say, while your courage is up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, I don’t think it was right in you to let
Kate give you breakfast and dinner the day your
father and mother went away.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“It was one of the best turns Kate ever served me.
I hope you haven’t been talking to her about it, and
putting notions of right and wrong into her head,
about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; I haven’t talked with Kate, and I don’t believe
the thought that she was deceiving her father ever
entered her mind; but she was, all the same. And
you let him think you had been kept on bread all day,
when I know that Kate gave you her own breakfast,
and was so afraid that somebody would find it out at
home, that she went to Mrs. Dobson’s to get something
to eat when she was hungry, and never once
told that she had gone without her breakfast for you.
And then she came home and gave you her dinner,
too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Frank, rising from his chair and peering
through the fog, “Kate is a good deal of a friend
of mine. I know perfectly well that if I should ask
her to run off to sea with me to-morrow, she would
cry a little and beg a good deal not to have me go,
and then would go with me after all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you are to blame, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To blame!” said Frank, the angry color rising in
his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the instant the door opened and Mrs. Hallock
looked in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have come for Mr. Green,” she said. “Little
Herbert is ill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s caught in the fog off the island,” said Frank,
“and hasn’t been here this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I do anything?” asked Harry, laying aside
slate and books—but Mrs. Hallock was gone.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>There was not a boatman in the village who would
not risk danger that he could see, to fetch Captain
Green to the little grandson whom he loved so well;
but to go forth, no one knew whither, into the dense
fog—of what use?</p>

<p class='c009'>At least that was the reply made to Harry Cornwall
at the town pier, when he gave the news.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who will lend me a boat?” questioned Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Youngster! you scarcely know how to pull an
oar,” was the only answer his question received.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the sea is calm, and the boy may die. It will
break the Captain’s heart not to see him again,” urged
Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boatmen looked up and down the harbor, as far
as the fog permitted them to see, and silently shook
their heads.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will pay you for the boat if I injure it,” said
Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the man, who was about to urge Harry’s
inability to pay, could speak, Frank Hallock reached
the pier.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s five dollars,” he cried, “for the man who
finds Captain Green and brings him in through
the fog.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In a moment a half dozen men stepped off the pier
into as many boats and began to pull down into the
fog. The harbor’s mouth was a half mile away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank and Harry lingered only to hear the last
stroke of oar, and then Harry suggested going down
to the Sound beach, past which the boats must go to
get to sea. When the shore was reached, the fog was
so dense that the boys could see no farther out than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>a few rolls of swollen water coming in from the east.
They began to shout with all their might and to listen
for an answer, but none came. Landward came
another sound. It was Kate, ringing, as she ran, the
schoolmaster’s bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought,” she said, coming to the shore, “that
maybe you’d be down here, and I was sure Captain
Green would know the sound of his own bell better
than anything else; and, I do declare, if here isn’t
Josh coming after me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Set him to howling,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us shout and ring and howl together,” proposed
Harry, and they began.</p>

<p class='c009'>The result was not, accurately speaking, a chorus,
but they made the air ring with sounds until Kate was
forced to drop the bell and cover her ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>When a pause was made, out of sheer exhaustion,
by boys and dog, they seemed to hear a voice out of
the fog.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Coming!” was the word they heard repeated.</p>

<p class='c009'>They rang the bell after an interval, and Josh,
seeming to understand, lifted up his mighty wail and
cast it on the fog.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Coming!” The answer came this time clearly
from the voice of Captain Green.</p>

<p class='c009'>In ten minutes more his little boat was drawn up on
the beach and he was on his way home. There was
no school that day. There was no school on the morrow,
nor for a week, because the lad lay very ill—and
then there was no school in the tower room any more,
for there was no little grandson, for love of whom
to teach.</p>

September was come, and the day on
which Frank was to go to school was
drawing very near. Frank himself was
devoting every minute that he could get
to bluefishing, and became very greatly
irritated at whatever came in the way of
his pleasure. He even came to regard
this going to school as something that
ought to be put off until bluefishing was
over; and as for “that provoking Harry Cornwall, he
was good for nothing at all—all the time doing something
in the lane, digging the potatoes, or pulling
onions, or anything but go a-fishing, as he, Frank Hallock,
wished him to do. Why, he hadn’t been out with
him to the island more than three times since September
came. And as for Kate, she was no good at
fishing, she wouldn’t bait his hook, but just wanted to
pull out the fish for her own self.” And yet Frank
admitted that he might have let her come out with him
in the <i>Clover</i>. It was a pretty boat—white and
green—that lay on the ripple of the blue Sound that
sweet September afternoon, and anyone passing it and
beholding the face of Frank Hallock, lighted up with
exultation as he whipped into his boat a gleaming bluefish,
a little larger than its fellows, would have thought
“What a fine-looking lad that is!” A cheery voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>from a passing boat, whose approach Frank had not
seen, called out, “Any good luck to-day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“First-rate luck,” answered Frank. “Where going,
Victor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Up to the dock after a new net.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When are you going to Long Island?” called
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Soon as we’ve fixed the net,” shouted back Victor.
“In a day or two we’ll be off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile the boat, plied by vigorous strokes, was
urging its way up the harbor, so that Frank’s “Wish
I was going with you!” failed to be heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was fishing just outside the harbor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to run up, mamma, and see the <i>Clover</i>. I
want to know that Frank is safe,” said Kate, at or
about the same time that Victor’s boat was at the town
wharf. From the tower room she could discern a
little speck, which she imagined to be a boat. She
went home and began to sew faster than ever, as
though to make up for time lost in going on her little
trip to investigate. Kate Hallock knew perfectly well
that something had happened to make her father and
mother uncomfortable. No one had said so, it is true,
but she felt the worry, whatever it was, that troubled
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamma,” said Kate, after a long bit of silence
between them. “I was very naughty the night you
came home from New York and told me Frank was
to go to school; for after I went to bed, I lay awake
thinking that I ought to go just as much as Frank,
and how ever so nice it would be to be at school and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>have a handsome brother like Frank coming, all
dressed in his uniform, to see me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Kate, my dear,” began Mrs. Hallock with a
sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before she could utter another word, Kate had cast
down her work and put her arms about her
mother’s neck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, mamma, I got over it right away, the very
instant I thought of all the lonely rooms for you at
home, and papa every night when he gets back from
business, and poor Neptune in his stall, with nobody
to love him much! It’s a lovely afternoon to go and
give Grandma Dobson a drive, she is always so sweet,
and ‘ready in a minute’ to go when I ask her! I
don’t really and truly, mamma, think it would be best
for me to go to school, even if you wished to have me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear,” said Mrs. Hallock, kissing the pretty
face close to her own, “what should you say if your
papa thought it best to sell Neptune?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sell my Neptune, mamma!” ejaculated Kate,
with a gasp. “I should say that I would rather live
on bread and water all the rest of my life—mortal
existence they call it in church, don’t they, mamma?”
with a miserable little attempt at a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate began dimly to discern that the trouble she
had felt related to money matters, and if economy
could save Neptune, economy she was ready to
practice to the utmost.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you had to choose, Kate, between Frank’s going
to school and keeping your pony?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I were Frank,” said Kate, “I should go to work
and help papa instead of going to school. But,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>mamma, tell me all about it. I thought papa was rich.
We live like rich folks, I am sure, and I don’t think
we ought to make any pretence about anything.
Grandma Dobson doesn’t, and I shouldn’t wonder one
bit if that is just the reason that her poor brown house
always seems so pleasant. Has papa lost much
money?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my dear. Your papa may have to give up
our pleasant home here; but we hope to keep it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate began to look very sorrowful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, mamma, why send Frank to school at all?”
she questioned. “It will cost ever so much money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have decided that it is best to do so, hoping
that Frank may become all that we wish him to be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Kate, “it will be nice, some day, to
have a president or a governor for a brother. I’ll do
without new dresses this winter, and squeeze into my
last winter’s cloak and shorten up my arms some way
to fit the sleeves. You remember they got pretty short
before the winter was over; and I’ll—let me see—what
can I do? I’ll do anything in the wide world to
keep Neptune. Why, mamma, I’d just as soon think
of selling Frank or you! I’ll manage to feed him
without costing papa one cent. There’s lots of salt
grass that nobody ever thinks of cutting, and then
there’s the pieces of bread that are always left.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Hallock smiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anyhow,” said Kate, blushing deeply and with
tears in her eyes, “you just leave the feeding part to
me; and I know Harry Cornwall will help me.
You’ve no idea the lots and lots of stuff he has raised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>this year; and I’m sure it will be real nice to make
sacrifices for dear Frank. You know, mamma, it will
be like the story books.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate grew quite eager as she ran on, planning what
she could do, if affairs got to the very worst; and she
was in the midst of it all when Frank came in with a
basket of fine fish, which he displayed with all a fisherman’s
pride.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has my uniform come yet?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamma!” asked Kate, “will Frank’s new clothes
cost much money?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, Kate!” cried Frank, “so you want all the
money for your own pretty dresses, do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I don’t, Master Frank; and I was wondering
whether the uniform would help any in making you a
great man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall never make a great man, Kate,” said Frank,
“and the sooner you give up that hope for me the
better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then,” said Kate, “I’ll make a great woman of
myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate had, in the midst of her utmost devotion to
Frank, moments of self-assertion. If he would not be
the actor in whom she could rejoice, then she felt the
necessity to be that which he would not be.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should not wonder one bit if you did,” mused
Frank. “Let me see—which one of the distinguished
will you pattern after?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Hallock had left the room after taking a glance
at Frank’s fish, so that Kate felt quite free to impart
the news she had received, in her own manner.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“Frank,” said Kate, her eyes shining, “if I were
you, I’d go to school and make of myself the very best
scholar I could. I’d learn and learn until I knew
enough to support myself and lots of folks besides—I
would. O, Frank! did you know that papa has lost
ever so much money, and that maybe Neptune will be
sold to pay for your uniform, or something?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whew!” cried Frank. “Who said so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamma told me so this very afternoon, and we are
going to do without ever so many things this winter,
to save money for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve noticed that something was going wrong for
some time,” said Frank, “and now it’s out. Well,
you can get along without Neptune, Kate, and it does
cost a great deal to keep a horse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much did papa pay for the <i>Clover</i>?” questioned
Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fifty dollars. I know, because I went with him
to buy it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can sell that, I know,” said Kate, assuredly,
“for I know who will buy it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Catch me selling my boat!” cried Frank; “indeed
I won’t. I shall want it every vacation, unless it’s at
Christmas holidays.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The <i>Clover</i> would be just as happy with anybody
else rowing it as with you in it, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What has that got to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, my poor Neptune would break his heart to
go away from his home and from me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense! Horses get used to things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, you know how much I love my pony, and
there is only one Neptune in the whole world for me;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>but there are plenty of boats that you wouldn’t know
from the <i>Clover</i>, that you can have some day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pshaw! Neptune would fetch a couple of hundred
dollars, I think, though he is rather slow and getting
a little old.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, that is it!” burst out Kate, with a flood of
tears running down her face. “He is getting old, and
somebody would begin to abuse him and sell him cheap
by-and-by; and he’d be driven off, lame and half
starved, by a cruel old fellow from a horse-market in
New York. I’ve seen them when I’ve been there, and
I’ve just wanted to be the general of the biggest army
that ever marched, and see if I couldn’t set some
things right and save the poor, old, lame, hungry
beasts that had done their best in their best days, working
away for their masters. Frank, Neptune sha’n’t
be sold to send you to school—there now!” and Kate
ran off to the stable and was having her cry out, with
her arms around Neptune’s neck, when Harry Cornwall,
passing by, heard her sobbing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What has happened, Kittie?” he questioned, looking
in.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was too late for Kate to pretend that she was not
crying and in real trouble, but Kate was too loyal to
her parents to tell what had happened, and so she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Harry, it isn’t anything that I can tell
you about. Perhaps you will know some day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She wiped her eyes and went in with Harry to show
him the splendid luck Frank had had fishing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See what you lost!” cried Frank, exultingly,
“when you might just as well as not have gone
with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“I couldn’t go without neglecting Mrs. Dobson’s
farm—I mean the onions,” said Harry, “and onions
will be fetching a good price presently. I’ve a good
many of them, too, and it’s just the weather to get
them in. I don’t mean to be selfish either,” continued
Harry, “but the onions and the oats are my crops on
shares. Mrs. Dobson gives me half, so you see I’ve a
special interest in silver-skins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know, Harry,” questioned Kate, “will
horses eat onions?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a goose!” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think they will, Kittie,” answered Harry.
“Why?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because,” bravely said Kate, “I’ve taken the
responsibility of keeping Neptune this winter, and I
knew you’d help me, Harry, with whatever you could
spare.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve a share in the oats, and you shall have all that
Neptune can eat. We’ve a good hundred bushels
between us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then Neptune will not suffer, and we’ll see what
can be done when Master Frank is off in his uniform
and everything is frozen up good and white for the
winter,” said Kate, with a feeling of relief concerning
Neptune.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Grandma Dobson, with a snowy white
cap sitting demurely upon her silver curls,
sat in the blue rocking chair, knitting a
gray sock. She was in the open doorway
and it was near sunset. The golden light
was all about the placid face, whose lines
of sweet patience seemed drawn clearer
and fairer than on any other afternoon
of her life.</p>

<p class='c009'>She knitted away with her busy fingers, her eyes
taking harvest of all the beauty lying toward the setting
sun. Now and then, looking at the quince trees
that grew along the garden wall, she made anew a
little calculation concerning the quantity of quinces
she could gather when the time for gathering should
come. There was always a good market for quinces.
Beyond the garden wall, concealed by the quince trees
that lay between, was the apple orchard, now heavy
with fruitage. Mrs. Dobson always enjoyed the apple
harvest, when there was an apple harvest to enjoy.
She remembered gathering apples from that orchard
for Captain Dobson to take away on the <i>Snow</i>, in the
year before they were married.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fingers knitted slower and slower, stumbling
over the stitches at last; then they ceased from effort,
and the gray sock was let fall across her dress. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>shadow came over the slant sunlight. Mrs. Dobson
caught up the sock, a half-guilty color suffusing face
and throat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I frighten you, grandma?” questioned Harry.
“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid it was my wicked thoughts that
frightened me, laddie. I was foolish enough to go
contrary to what God thinks best for me, and when
you came so quick around the corner, I was wondering
what on earth I should do if Captain Dobson should
come back—so foolish, after more than thirty years!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you wouldn’t even know him, would you?”
questioned Harry, dropping his hat on the door stone
and sitting down beside it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Harry, I think I should. I’m sure I’d feel
very bad if Captain Dobson didn’t remember <i>me</i>, and
I never doubt that he would remember me as long as
he did anything about this world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And nobody ever was known to come back after
being gone thirty years, was there, grandma?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nobody that I ever heard of; and, Harry, it is
only when I sit down and dream awake, or in my sleep,
that I ever believe that he can. I haven’t let myself
play he comes in a long time before, and I shouldn’t
now, but I was waiting for you to come home to tea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I almost hope he won’t come,” said Harry, “’cause
if he did, I should have to move on somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you don’t care to go?” questioned Mrs. Dobson,
with a little breath of eagerness. “I was afraid,
when there was so much talk of Frank’s going off to
the grand school, that my boy would grow discontented.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“Not a bit of it, grandma. I got grandeur enough
at the circus to last me a lifetime. I’m sorry sometimes,
though, because I see so much make-believe in
’most everything. I wonder if it is wicked to hate
make-believe as much as I do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me! Harry Cornwall, what can I do if you
begin to hate me?” exclaimed Mrs. Dobson, thrusting
the knitting-needles into parallel lines through the
sock and looking with severity at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No danger of that, grandma. You are as transparent
as the water in this well—and you know it is
relied on always for pure clearness. I must have a
drink, and while we are at tea I’ve something to
tell you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the table Harry related nearly everything that
had happened at the Point during his little visit there,
together with his thoughts and fears of what might
happen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear, dear me!” sighed Mrs. Dobson. “What can
we—you and I, Harry—do for our friends?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can wait and watch for a chance, grandma.
It won’t do to let on what we’ve found out. When
everybody knows about the trouble, then we can seem
to know it, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought you hated make-believe, my laddie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That isn’t what I mean by making believe. I
found Kate sobbing away and telling her grief to her
pony, and I more than half think that Neptune understood
every word she said, too.” Then suddenly turning
his bright face upon Mrs. Dobson, the boy said:
“I know one way to help them, a little.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is that?” she asked, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“Oh! a way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell it!” with a near approach to impatience for
Mrs. Dobson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To have your dream come true, grandma! because,
then, you would not need me. I should be in the way
here, and I’ve an immense good opinion of myself—I
could make myself very useful over at the Point, and
save money in a good many ways for Mr. Hallock
that Hugo never thinks of.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can get along beautifully without you,” said
Mrs. Dobson, after a pause, “that is, until the spring;
after you get the crops all in, I mean; and you could
come over once in a while by running across your
bridge, even if it was cold weather.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, grandma, you’re making believe you’d get
along comfortably without me,” said Harry, reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I am not,” she said, trying very hard to steady
her voice. “I didn’t say there wouldn’t be <i>very hard</i>
days and unpleasant hours. I said I could get along
nicely, and so I can, and will, if it seems best.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And here we are a-dreaming away, when perhaps
I am not wanted at all,” said Harry, “and Primrose
is waiting by this time at the bars for me. If Captain
Dobson should come before I get through milking,
grandma, you swing the strainer—here it is” (catching
it from a gooseberry bush by the door and tossing
it to her), “white as snow—for I want a chance to run
upstairs and put myself in order to do you honor
before a visitor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What dreamers we are, to be sure,” sighed Mrs.
Dobson, as she watched the lad go his way past the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>quince trees and through the orchard to the meadow-bars,
where Primrose waited.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun was just dropping out of sight. She
watched it with eyes that grew misty with wistfulness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Foolish! foolish!” she murmured, smiling the
very ghost of a smile, as she turned to gather up the
cups and plates from the tea table.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Harry fetched in the milk she was washing
them, just as usual, he thought, while she was thinking
that if Harry could be of more service at the
Point than in the Lane, he ought to go there.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning Frank Hallock went bounding
into the brown house to exhibit himself in the uniform
which had arrived the night before. “The swamp-bridge
is a capital institution, Harry,” he said.
“When I go to Congress, I’ll vote for swamp-bridges
all along the coast. How do you like me in my fine
feathers?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Dobson surveyed Frank’s fine figure and erect
carriage, and pronounced the uniform “fit for any
gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry remarked: “My mother used to say that real
soldiers are always gentlemen, and never” (he added
on his own account) “leave a lady to find her way
alone across a marsh, as our soldier left his sister
just now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! you mean Kate,” said Frank, too well pleased
at the moment to resent anything that anyone might
say. “Kate had no need to come. She only wanted
to hear what you would say to my new clothes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And just here Kate presented herself, panting for
breath and disappointed. She had lost that first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>expression of pleased surprise that she longed to see.
However, her enjoyment was too simple and genuine
to be long delayed at any time, and one or two laughing
sentences from her precious brother made far
away the wrong of a few moments ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be so grand, Frank, that you can’t come to
see me. I am afraid the military school will spoil
you for the old brown house and Grandma Dobson,”
Mrs. Dobson said, as they were about to go home.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll come at the Christmas vacation,” replied Frank,
“and bring three or four of the fellows and spend the
day here. You see if I don’t! I’ll be civil enough,
though, to let you know when, for four or five of us
would eat an awful sight of your rye bread.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll come over the day before and help you make
it, grandma, and then I’ll come that day and help eat
it,” said Kate, kissing the dear soul good-bye, and
departing in jubilant spirits with Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us go home by the way of the town wharf,”
said Frank. “I want to find out if there’s any chance
of getting to the island to-day; and maybe we’ll catch
Captain Green or some of the fishermen there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank had left unexpressed his strong motive for
going, but Kate added: “O, yes, Frank, and then they
can see your perfectly lovely uniform. You can’t
think how fine you look and how proud of you in it
I am. I’d rather not have a single new thing to wear
this winter and be able to see you in it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What an admiring duck you are!” observed Frank.
“In return, I’ll get together the best set of adjectives
I can muster to do you honor in your next finery”—with
which promise they came within sight of the pier.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>On it a stranger was walking and peering with interest
into every little boat thereabout.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder who that is,” said Frank, straightening
himself and walking down the wharf as though he
owned it and the harbor also. Kate straightened her
hat and walked demurely by his side. Kate could not
assume airs and graces that were not her own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good morning, my lad,” said the stranger to
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good morning,” returned Frank, a little stiff at
having been called “my lad” by the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That uniform looks very well, indeed. I didn’t
think it could be so exact a fit as it is,” remarked the
man. “You are the son of Mr. Hallock at the Point
yonder. I know,” he added with a smile, “for I sent
that suit to him yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you are Mr. North,” returned Frank, not
quite so freezing in his air of boyish consequence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and perhaps you can help me. I come out to
this region very often during the fall and winter for
duck-shooting, and I have so great difficulty in securing
a boat that I wish to buy one. Do you know of
one for sale?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” spoke up impulsive Kate; “there is your
own boat, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll lend it to you to-day,” said Frank pleasantly
to Mr. North, adding with a lordly look in Kate’s
direction, “but my boat is not for sale.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. North walked to the Point with the children,
and, having secured the boat, soon departed for the
day. He returned at evening and was a good deal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>surprised at seeing the young girl he had noticed with
Frank in the morning, waiting at the little boathouse,
apparently to meet him. He was astonished when she
questioned him thus:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you wish to buy my brother’s boat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, if he will sell it to me; it is a good little affair
and answers my purpose nicely: that is, if it can be
taken care of here for me until the spring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, yes,” said Kate. “But how much will you give
for it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much does your brother ask for it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, I don’t know as he will sell it; but I know how
much my father paid for it. He gave forty dollars in
the spring, and Frank named it to please me; but I
wish he would sell it and you would buy it.” Then
with a quick impulse, Kate asked, “How much did
Frank’s new clothes cost?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without giving direct reply, Mr. North said: “We
will make an exchange, if your brother pleases—I will
take the boat for the uniform.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a good way! Thank you,” said Kate softly,
and before the words had died away upon the air, she
was off to the house with the good news to Frank, but
Frank was not at home. When he did arrive, he was
cross and peevish, and would not take with a grain of
good sense or amiability one word that Kate said; and
so she resolved to keep her secret about the boat until
morning.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The following morning Kate waited with
exceeding patience for the proper moment
to arrive in which to speak to Frank
regarding the <i>Clover</i> and Mr. North.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I told him, Frank,” she went on
to say, as he stood glowering at her from
his superior height, “that the boat cost—I
mean that papa paid forty—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was fifty dollars, Kate,” ejaculated
Frank, “that was paid for the boat; and if you
hadn’t—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank!” besought Kate, with an eager tremble
in her voice, “I am so sorry I forgot. I thought it
was forty; but you can tell him and then you’ll get
back ten dollars that you can spend just as you please;
and you are always wanting new things, you know.
You can buy, Frank, that nice new kind of a fishpole
that you asked papa for, or you can get—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just like you,” returned Frank, interrupting her
suggestion. “A fishpole would do me a good deal of
good without the <i>Clover</i> to go with it. I’ll tell you
what, I’ll just keep my boat and get the pole in some
way. Mother will help me out with it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank Hallock! if you only knew what mamma
is doing, and going to do, this winter, you’d never
think of asking her for a penny. When you are gone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Mary is going away and we will only have the cook
and mamma, and I am going to do all Mary’s work;
and I heard papa talking about having only Hugo or
some one other man to do everything that is to be done
outside of the house. I shall enjoy helping about
everything so much, dear Frank, when I think that
you are having a good time at school and it is making
you happier.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank turned away without a word and went out
into the sweet, cool air of the morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate ran lightly up the staircase, and in two minutes
came down again with hat and wrappings on to drive
her father to the railway station.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hallock appeared presently, looking very grave
and anxious. As he came, Kate said: “All ready,
papa, and waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kate, dear,” he replied, “I have a reason for
wishing that Frank should go with me this morning,
and you may meet me this afternoon at five. I’m
coming home early to-day. Good-bye, my child,” and
he gave the disappointed face a kiss and went out.
Kate followed, thinking to find Frank for her father.
The boy was already at the stable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Frank!” said Mr. Hallock, “I wish you to
go with me this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t Kate go, or Hugo?” returned Frank. “The
tide is just right for fishing and it will use up half
an hour or more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get in,” said his father, sternly. With a frown
and a surly air, Frank slipped into the light wagon and
threw himself upon the seat.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“Never mind, Frank,” urged Kate in a low voice,
close to the wheel on Frank’s side. As the horse
started, she added: “I’ll have the fishing-tackle all
ready for you, and the bait, too, if I can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hallock drove and not a word had been spoken
when they reached the village. As they were passing
along the principal street, Mr. Hallock said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My son, I am in the midst of cares and business
difficulties that you cannot understand. Your mother
and myself are willing to do many things this winter,
in order to send you to school. We do it gladly, out
of love for you. If you could stay fourteen a year or
two, it would not matter so much whether or not you
went this winter; but time is precious. Now, my boy,
Kate told me last night that Mr. North suggested
taking your boat, and I wish you to part from it cheerfully
and without a word of repining. It is yours,
and it is you who must write to him to-day and tell
him that he can have it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, father—” and then came the signal of the
advancing train. In two minutes Mr. Hallock was
upon it on his way to New York and Frank was
rushing with speed through the village on his way
home, cherishing, as he went, no very kind feeling
toward his sister Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having left the horse, he was going toward the
boathouse, when Kate appeared on the highway, carrying
a basket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was afraid to stay a minute longer,” she said,
when they came within speaking distance. “I was so
afraid you would be gone, Frank. I found a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>clams—look! enough to keep you in bait quite
awhile,” Kate continued, speaking very rapidly, as
though apprehensive of interruption. “You know,
Frank, you are going to be a beautiful brother and
let Mr. North have the <i>Clover</i>; and mamma said I
might go fishing with you to-day, if you would keep
inside the harbor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kate Hallock!” exclaimed Frank, “it was none of
your business to go telling father what Mr. North
said. I could tell him myself, when I wanted him to
know anything about it. No! I won’t let you go with
me just because you did tell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank! I thought papa would be so very glad,
because I heard him say that he needed every single
dollar he could save; and I thought you would be as
happy as I was myself, when he said he would do it.
And I went and got your lines and clams and everything;
and I don’t care to fish, so I’ll bait your hook
every time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Kate; I’ve got to give up the boat, and I will
have it all to myself this last day; besides, it is still,
and if I see Captain Green outside, I’m going out
beyond the island to fish. So you see you could
not go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Frank, don’t go alone; please don’t! Get Harry
Cornwall to go with you,” she urged; but he resisted
that appeal, and saying there was no time to spare in
hunting up Harry, who was doubtless off in some
potato field or other, kept on his way to the little boathouse
where the <i>Clover</i> lay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell you what, Frank,” said Kate, her heart
beating fast with hope, “I’ll run across lots to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Lane and find him, and I’m sure he’ll go if I ask him;
and you can wait and fish a few minutes down by the
coal dock, till he has time to get there. I’ll be as
quick as ever I can. I don’t believe mamma will care
if I do not stop to go back and ask her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate was running by the time she finished speaking,
and she did not hear Frank’s last call, which was “I
sha’n’t wait a minute for anybody”; and she did not
stop until she reached the stone wall that separated the
meadow lands from the highway. When she stood
within the low doorway of Mrs. Dobson’s kitchen, she
could only gasp forth,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s Harry?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matter with you, Kittie, my Clover?
You’re as—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please tell me quick where Harry is,” panted forth
Kate. “I must find him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you come right in and sit down until you get
your breath and I’ll go call him. He’s topping corn
this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Kate knew the Dobson cornfield just as well
as anyone, and off she started, before Mrs. Dobson
could take down her sunbonnet and shawl from its
peg on the kitchen wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Arrived there, she shouted for Harry, who presently
appeared out of the corn and hastened to the fence
where Kate waited.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed so trivial, this calling Harry away from
real, necessary-to-be-done work to go fishing, just
because Frank would run into danger, that for an
instant, as Harry came forward, she resolved to let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Frank go; but the wave of fear returned upon her by
the time he reached the fence and she cried out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Harry, will you do something for me? Tell me
‘yes’ quick!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know I will, Kittie,” said Harry, removing his
hat to wipe his forehead—for he had been working
fast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then go fishing right off with Frank; it’s the
last time he’s going in the <i>Clover</i>, and he would go
off to the island. Make haste now and you can catch
him at the coal dock. He has gone down the harbor
and he is all alone, and if the wind should blow”—she
said, with a sudden tremble in her tones—“or if
the fog should come and he off there fishing all
alone—”</p>

<p class='c009'>Whether it were the pleading of Kate’s eyes or of
her voice, or the arguments she used that influenced
Harry, it were impossible to determine; but he went
in haste across field and meadow to the coal dock, only
to see Frank and the <i>Clover</i> making great speed outside
the harbor toward the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he stood there, helpless, on the beach, watching
the boat, Kate reached his side, and, seeing her brother
in the distance, she burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure I did everything I could,” she sobbed.
“Only if Frank should get lost, I never, never could
forgive myself for having told papa!” and Kate sank
down on the sand and cried out her sorrow and disappointment,
as well as her weariness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry waited patiently until the little storm was
over. Then he said:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“If you were to tell me all about it, don’t you think
I could help you a little?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wanted to tell you ever since I knew,” sighed
Kate, with one tear-dimmed glance seaward, “only I
thought that perhaps papa and mamma might wish it
not spoken of; but now I am sure—” and then Kate
went on to tell Harry all that she knew and thought,
and a good deal that she felt, about affairs at home.
At last she said, “I can bear everything but to let Neptune
go. If poor Nep goes, Harry, I want to go
with him. He’s my friend—just as Josh is Mrs. Dobson’s;
and O, Harry, <i>do</i> you think I ought to tell papa
he may sell him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry was trying to see Frank’s <i>Clover</i>, but somehow
it looked very much as though it had been caught
in a sudden fog; but it was a fog easily brushed away
from the lad’s eyes, as he turned to say to Kate:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If, Kittie, it comes to selling Neptune, promise me
one thing—that you will not let him go until you have
told me about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I promise, Harry; but what good will that do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will see when the time comes. I am glad you
have told me. But, Kittie, I must not spend my
morning here. If the wind blows hard, I will go to
the town wharf and get a boat to go out after Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamma has not the least idea that I am not gone
with Frank. I must go home and tell her,” said
Kate; and thus they parted, Kate going by the way of
the brown house to explain her conduct to Mrs. Dobson,
and Harry to the cornfield, summing up as he
went, for the fortieth or fiftieth time, his little earthly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>all and wondering whether or not it would do any
good to get it all together, in readiness for an
emergency.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day went on, bright and warm for the season,
until the afternoon came, and with it there breathed
in from the sea a cool, damp air, that presently, almost
before one thought of it, changed all the atmosphere
to dense fog.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate had many times during the morning hours
made little visits to the tower room and adjusted the
glass, to take into view Frank’s boat. Seeing it, lying
off the island and nearby another boat—Captain
Green’s, without doubt—she had ceased to feel
troubled. Even Mrs. Hallock was satisfied with
Kate’s reports, as they came to her from time to time,
and contented herself, being very busy in preparing
Frank’s clothing for school, until she saw the fog
sweep past the windows. Hugo was sent off in haste
to learn the whereabouts of Captain Green and the
whole household grew anxious and restless.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate drove Neptune to the station to meet her
father, and greeted him with the news that Frank was
off fishing outside of the island, all alone, when the fog
came down.</p>

<p class='c009'>The September twilight followed. It was night and
still the fog held down. The old sea began to roll with
an easterly swell, and Frank was not heard from.
Kate put every lamp that she could muster into the
tower room, for a lighthouse.</p>

<div class='c008'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_149.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
As Frank rowed down the harbor in the
morning, he saw himself clearly, in the
light of conscience, as a selfish, contemptible
brother. He admitted to himself that
he ought to have taken Kate in the <i>Clover</i>
and given her a morning’s pleasure on this
one of the latest days he should be at
home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two or three times he half yielded to
the impulse to go back for her and began to row with
uncertain weak stroke outward, when, with sudden
impetus, Victor, from the island, shot past him with
the call “You’d better hurry! Capital morning for
fishing, and we’re off at high water for Long Island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s my last chance to see the fishing-boats and the
old mill and everything, and mother won’t let Kate go
outside any time,” thought Frank, and he bent to the
oars and shot past the coal dock, as seen by Kate and
Harry in the last chapter.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the island everyone was busy preparing to leave
for new fishing-grounds—the season for fishing in
that part of the Sound being nearly past. The great
seines were being taken down from the reels along the
side of the wharf, casks of water were going out to
sloops in small boats, and every fisherman was getting
together his individual belongings, to say good-bye to
the island for weeks to come.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Frank made the <i>Clover</i> fast to the wharf, climbed
the ladder and wandered about awhile, watching the
work that was going on and secretly wondering
whether or not if he had worn his uniform the men
would have paid more heed to him, for a chance word
was all the attention he could elicit, until Victor
returned from town. Victor had been to the postoffice
to obtain the latest news from the homes of the
men before they should set sail. Victor distributed his
letters and then went, accompanied by Frank, “to
pack up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he proceeded to thrust into a huge carpet-bag
his belongings, he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wanted to see that land toggery of yours you’re
going to school in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t much,” answered Frank. “You’ll see it
maybe at Christmas. You’ll be back here before that
time to lay up for winter and I’ll be at home at vacation.”
Then suddenly turning upon Victor, he asked,
“Why don’t you go home for Christmas? I should
think you’d want to see your home again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going some day,” said Victor, his blue eyes
gleaming and his beautiful white teeth showing to
advantage. “I’ll take you home to Germany. There’s
much Christmas coming—plenty of time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But folks die between one Christmas and another,”
remarked Frank, adding, “however, I hope your folks
will not, and I’ve half a mind to run away and go to
Germany with you, when you do go, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll remember you when I let go for the Fatherland,”
replied Victor, as he gave vigorous thrusts to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>get into the bag a pair of boots. The bag, large as it
was, refused to close over them; and so he made it
fast with a rope, threw it over his shoulder, and carried
it down to the landing.</p>

<p class='c009'>At that instant the dinner-horn was blown from the
door of the little house on the island, and every man,
notwithstanding his haste, immediately responded with
his presence. At the last dinner of the fishing season
Frank was present and assisted vigorously, after
which he rowed Victor and his big bag in the <i>Clover</i>
out to Victor’s boat. Then he bade him good-bye and
stood off while the sails went up and the anchors were
hoisted on board a dozen yachts of the fishing fleet.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a sad sight to Frank and to Captain Green,
who was fishing outside the island, to see the brave
boats stepping away into the distance. The tide being
fair and the wind light, they were a long time in sight;
and the old man fishing thought the Sound would be
lonely now, and the boy “was rather glad he was
going away to school, after all; there wouldn’t be
so much fun now on the water, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank felt dispirited. He would have picked up his
oars and rowed for home had he not heard an
exclamation from Captain Green, who at the instant
pulled in a fish of extraordinary size, which Frank
seeing, felt a desire to do likewise. So for the first
time that day, Kate’s clams came into service, and
Frank fell to fishing with right good will. It was, as
Victor had remarked in the morning, “a capital day
for fishing”; either the bait was very alluring or the
fish were very hungry, for they bit vigorously and
came into the boats in great numbers.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>The <i>Clover</i> lay about five hundred feet from Captain
Green’s position, and, so rapidly did the fog come
down upon them—busy at baiting and pulling in—that
neither the experienced man nor the inexperienced boy
knew of its approach until it had shut them in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sakes alive!” shouted Captain Green. “Frank!
Frank Hallock!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank responded, thinking Captain Green must have
pulled up anchor and moved position since last he
noticed him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold on!” called the Captain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m holding on!” screamed back Frank, trying his
best to pierce the fog with his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no! I’ll hold on and you get up anchor and
pull for me—that will be the better way—and we’ll
keep together till we get in somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aye, aye, sir!” yelled Frank, wondering what in
the world made Captain Green get around on the other
side of him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Confound the boy!” thought the man in a rage.
“I wonder how he got outside of me without my
knowing it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now it so happened that neither boat had changed
position since the fishing station had been chosen.
Frank toiled at the anchor line and pulled the boat out
to it and lifted it on board, then took up his oars and
rowed a few strokes. Hearing nothing from Captain
Green, he paused and gave a call.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here; this way—row this way,” responded the
Captain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right; I’m coming,” gleefully from Frank,
reached his ears; and then he listened, thinking it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>quite time he should hear the oar-strokes of the
advancing boat. Meanwhile Frank peered cautiously
at the veil of fog, trying to discern the outline of his
friend’s boat and feeling very glad to know that it was
there somewhere near him, even though he could not
see it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are you?” from Captain Green, boomed
against the bank of fog. He called again—he
shouted—he roared; and Frank, hearing the faintest
note of it, kept on rowing in the direction whence the
sound seemed to come. Poor Frank was following the
voice of Echo, instead of the warm, palpitating notes
that the half-distracted Captain sent after him; he was
rowing after the phantom voice that lured him farther
and farther away from the land.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s time I got to him; I’m sure it is,” thought
Frank, no suspicion of the truth entering his mind.
Gaily he accosted his neighbor. “Ring the school-bell,
Captain, and I will come,” he called, and seemed to
hear, in response, a knell of sound, as of some deep,
far-away fog-bell booming solemnly.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the first time in his life, as the <i>Clover</i> lay on the
slow swell of the sea that he might listen, Frank Hallock
felt a thrill of fear. What could it mean?
Where <i>was</i> Captain Green? <i>Could</i> he have gone off
and left him out there all alone?</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank called and listened, and called again until his
voice grew dull and husky with shouting, and the only
sound that seemed to respond was that dreadful toll,
whether of his own heart beating or of fog-bell, he
could not tell.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Meanwhile Captain Green, becoming thoroughly
alarmed at the non-appearance of the <i>Clover</i>, pulled
up his own anchor and began to row in the direction
Frank’s boat had lain. After rowing around for
awhile, he concluded to let his boat drift with the tide,
knowing that in time it would take him toward the
land. It so happened that the sound of water, swashing
on the stones of the island, assailed his hearing,
and, after many attempts, he succeeded in following
the sound to its source.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having landed on the island, he immediately gave
the alarm, and, after having secured a boat and an
oarsman, set forth in search of Frank, with a compass
as guide and the dinner-horn as trumpet.</p>

<p class='c009'>They rowed north and south and east and west, the
Captain acting as trumpeter, and the only answer
obtained from all their efforts was one shrill steam-whistle
as a passing steamboat made haste to change
its course to get out of the way of a supposed sailing
vessel.</p>

<p class='c009'>During all this time Frank Hallock was pulling out
to sea, firmly believing that he was making for the
Connecticut coast. He heard neither horn nor call
nor whistle, as he steadily moved on his course.
Meanwhile the afternoon had been passing and the
early evening was drawing near. To Frank the fog
seemed to be deepening, but it was the deepening of
darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many times he laid down his oars and set his ears to
listen with an intentness that made him feel as though
he was all ears. He imagined many sounds, but heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>nothing except the splash of his own boat’s bow on
the sullen sea; then he would take up his oars, and,
counting a hundred strokes, lay them down and listen
once again; but each and every time with the same
sickening failure to hear sound of helping man.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not until the darkness grew to night, and
night unrelieved by light or star, that Frank became
thoroughly alarmed—and that he felt to the full the
dulling drench of the fog. It seemed to sink down
through the crown of his cap and suffuse hair and
brain; it seemed to be swept through him from
shoulder to shoulder, and his very feet turned limp
and his knees shook as he arose and tried to stand for
a moment, to relieve the cramp that had settled down
upon them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O that it would rain or blow or do anything but
fog on like this,” he thought. “I wonder what Kate
would do out here now, to-night!” Nevertheless,
Frank could not help wishing, far down in his heart,
that Kate was with him out there, and he began to be
very sorry that she was not, for somehow a savor of
comfort seemed always to be around Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whatever else came of the fog, loss of appetite did
not, and Frank began to feel all the beseeching of
hunger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder how long a fellow could live out here,
anyhow,” he murmured, “if it should go on fogging
forever, and if, after a day or two of it, I should want
my supper as much as I do now? I want a loaf of
rye bread and a couple of quarts of milk like everything,
and I wouldn’t mind having an apple, or even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>a glass of water would taste first-rate. There must
be sailing craft around here thick as berries in a pudding—if
I could only run against one now.” But the
only thing Frank ran against was deeper darkness and
now and then a denser fog-bank.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last button of Frank’s coat was buttoned ere
long. Whatever else of cold there was to come, he
must bear as best he could. He rowed a little to keep
warm and shouted a good deal, and began to feel the
awful pressure of loneliness clasping him tighter and
tighter. At last the cold damp affected his strained
eyeballs to such degree that he was compelled to shut
his eyes; and then somehow—exactly how he could
not understand—he began to see himself, not out
there, mistbound in the cool autumn evening, tossing
up and down on the swell of the sea, but just himself
as he was, as he had been living from day to day in
his home, and his selfishness began to grow into something
awful. He wished he could remember a few
kind, nice, good things that he had done for somebody
over there on that queer land, that must be somewhere,
but which seemed so far away, and a good deal more
like a dream than—but what was that noise? Frank
shouted to it, but the rolling porpoise did not think
it worth while to wait and make reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last, thoroughly worn out, Frank sank down
gradually into his boat and began to sob. There was
no one to hear and he sobbed on until the misery of
the darkness and the breathing waters grew into him.
He wanted something that he had not; he wanted the
solid land and safety; home, with its love and warmth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>its lights and food; and all at once he wanted something
more even than these—he wanted the God of the
sea, in whose dreadful clasp he was caught, to be his
friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was tired of rowing, tired of calling, tired of
everything. He wanted to go to sleep. Yes, Frank
was, as he had said, fourteen and over and could take
care of himself; but he, for the first time in many,
many nights, went back to that most comforting form
of petition, “Now I lay me.” With a firm resolve
to be a better boy, sell the <i>Clover</i>, and be kind to Kate
and love everybody, and always tell the truth and do
just right, if he ever got to land, Frank sank into a
state of damp unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he awoke, the boat was tossing up and down;
the fog was, if anything, denser than ever, and he was
so stiff that on the first trial he could not sit up. To
have had no supper was uncomfortable, to go breakfastless
was hard; but the day was dawning. A
light fog would be a few degrees better than a dark
one; besides, by this time all the boats in the harbor
must be beating about in search of him. But no boat
found him all that long, cold day, and another night
found Frank Hallock, limp and helpless and half
unconscious, lying in the <i>Clover</i>, which drifted and
drifted in the open Sound. It was the longest fog
that had been known in many years.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>Chapter XVI.</h2>
</div>

<div class='c008'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_158.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Again and again Kate Hallock reiterated
the statement that only a little while
before the fog came she saw two boats
lying near the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The boy is safe enough at the island,”
said every one of the boatmen to whom
Mr. Hallock applied for advice concerning
the proper thing to do. Mr. Hallock
himself believed that Frank was there
and tried his utmost to convince Mrs. Hallock and
Kate that Captain Green must have seen the fog
coming in and would, without any doubt, look after
the safety of Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish somebody would go over at low water and
find out,” said Mrs. Hallock; and Harry Cornwall,
hearing the words, determined to go.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as soon as the fog lifts, I will go myself,” said
Mr. Hallock, assuring his wife that until such time
it would be unsafe for anyone to attempt it. To find
one’s way across the wide stretch of sands, crossed a
number of times by streams running from the salt
meadows to the sea, would be wellnigh impossible.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was low water on that night at midnight. An
hour before that time, Harry Cornwall went to Mrs.
Dobson’s door and told her that he was going to try to
reach the island.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>In vain were all of Mrs. Dobson’s efforts to intimidate
him: the darkness had no power to do it; the fog
was something the experience of which he could not
imagine; and, as for the possible quicksands into
which he might wander, he was willing to take the
chances, only too happy in the thought that by striding
through danger he might be able to relieve the anxiety
at the Point.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a lantern in his hand and matches to light it, if
necessary; with a board under his arm, as defense
against a possible descent into the mud, he set forth,
followed by Mrs. Dobson’s fears, and—in the distance—by
Mrs. Dobson herself and Josh.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Lane was narrow, or the way would soon have
been a damp mystery to everybody concerned.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry went hurriedly, wishing to get to the bar
before it should be low water; and he had reached the
shore and plunged along fearlessly over quite a
stretch of the tide-left sands before Mrs. Dobson was a
hundred yards down the Lane. He was quite certain
that he had followed the bank in about a straight line
for the bar, and was going on famously when he found
himself in a few inches of water.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The creek!” he said to himself, delightedly. “I’m
a third of the distance already to the bar; and when I
get upon that, it will be as easy as the Lane, for I shall
be fenced in with the sea.” With this assurance he
went boldly into the creek, finding the water somewhat
higher than the stage of the tide would lead one to
expect. Harry had dug clams along the border of
this creek many times and felt quite familiar with it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>even in a fog—only it did seem wider than usual, as
well as deeper; in fact, he soon felt persuaded that he
was going either up the creek or down it, instead of
across; but this creek seemed as wide as it was long,
and on which side lay the land it was impossible to tell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll try every direction,” he thought, “by turns,”
and he went all around the compass; but whichever
way he seemed to turn, he always found himself in
deeper water. He tried to light the lantern, but the
matches in his pocket were already wet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry was compelled to admit that he had lost his
way. The situation was anything but pleasant and
very far from being a safe one, unless release should
come before the turn of tide. He stood still awhile
and listened. Reader, were you ever lost in a fog?
If not, you cannot have the slightest conception of
Harry’s feeling as he stood there. If he could wait
until the next train passed, up or down, its signal
whistles might guide him, but then the tide would have
been two hours rising.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this time the board had been tightly clasped
under Harry’s arm. “How glad I am,” he suddenly
exclaimed. “At least this board will float down with
the tide and I shall know which way the land lies.”
He laid it on the water, intending only to let it slip
for an instant from his hand, when lo! it vanished
into the mist and the darkness. Harry tried his
utmost to vanish in the opposite direction, but it was
all of no use. He wandered about with care, only to
find that the water was gaining on him with every
renewed effort. Truly, Harry Cornwall was in worse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>plight than Frank Hallock when midnight came to the
two lads.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, on the little island, Captain Green had
been anxiously awaiting the approach of low tide, that
he might make the venture to reach the mainland. He
was full of solicitude regarding the whereabouts of
Frank and wished to give the alarm as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a brass cannon on the island, used chiefly
to acquaint Long Island Sound with the presence of
the Fourth of July on the land.</p>

<p class='c009'>Giving directions that this cannon be fired should
news of Frank be received, Captain Green started, in
company with one of the workmen of the mill, for
the Connecticut shore. They were aided by the light
of a lantern and their guide was a compass.</p>

<p class='c009'>During this time Mrs. Dobson, unwilling to be left
alone in the mysterious fog even for a minute, held
Josh by the collar and slowly felt her way along the
Lane fence to the beach, wishing with all her heart,
as she went, “that the Lord had not made boys and
men so venturesome. Poor, dear lad!” she thought,
as she stumbled along from post to post. “He never
will get there! He’ll be lost on the awful sands! the
cruel, creeping tide will draw him down. O, Harry,
Harry!” and then she was crying out to him in the
thick darkness, for at last she was come to the brink
of the bank leading down to the sea-sands.</p>

<p class='c009'>At her cry of “Harry! Harry!” Josh made one
bounding leap for freedom, which he gained with a
glad bark and was off, leaving Mrs. Dobson alone.
Into the mist leaped Josh, easily following Harry, until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>he lost scent at the water’s edge. Then he stopped
and uttered a few barks, just enough to reach the
hearing of Harry and to gladden his heart more than
I can tell.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry whistled, and in plunged the dog, getting to
his friend in a marvelously short time and uttering
his thankfulness at having found him by a perfect
jubilation of sound, that made the old fog-banks, landward
and seaward, echo and reecho his joy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Green and his companion had come to the
land-end of the bar, where they also heard the bark.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure’s I live,” said the mill-man, “that was Josh
Dobson’s bark! I wonder what in the world he’s out
on the coast for this night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somebody’s out there, lost, trying to cross, you
may be sure,” replied Captain Green, and he sent a
cheery call as far into the night as his voice would
carry it, and all the time he was keeping close to the
sea’s edge, by the dim, misty light of his lantern,
anxious not to lose the water-line for an instant.</p>

<p class='c009'>They shouted singly as they went, and they shouted
together, and at length Harry, floundering still under
Josh’s guidance, heard the call and responded. With
the regularity of a fog-bell’s toll came the call and
answer, until at last Harry caught the lantern’s glimmering
light, and shortly after saw two forms, like
giants, stretching out of the misty darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>The joy of being found and safe was quickly
obscured by the news of Frank’s loss, which Captain
Green and he together bore to Hallock Point, having
left Mrs. Dobson safe at home on the way with Josh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>to guard her—although I’m quite sure no eye would
have suspected that the brown house was in the Lane
that night.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dawn came at last, but the fog was not gone.
It seemed denser than ever; boats went down the
harbor and outside, but came back only too soon, to
say that it was of no use, nothing could be done,—clear
weather could alone solve the mystery.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the day was long on the shore, it was yet longer
to the lad in the boat. He rowed aimlessly; as dinner
time came he looked at the fish, a few of which lay in
the boat, and wondered if he could eat raw fish. He
varied his rowing with sitting afloat and shouting.
He shouted and shouted, until he had changed the
monotony by calling “Father,” and “Mother,” and
“Kate,” and “Harry,” and every name of boy or
man it seemed to him that he had ever known; and
not one, of all the number, would give answer to his
great beseeching.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the day when on the cold increased, and the great
sea beneath him rolled in a sullen swell that grew with
the cold. At length Frank knew that another night
was gathering on the face of the waters. All the hope
that with so many sails on the Sound, one must come
out of the mist, somewhere, to meet him, died out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Frank! he burst into a passion of tears. He
felt forgotten, neglected. It seemed to him that somebody
might at least have tried to find him. If it had
been Kate now, and he had been on shore, why, he
would have had boats, as thick as berries, out looking
for her.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Frank’s tears made him colder than ever. He took
up a fish for the first time and looked at it. With
fast numbing fingers he scraped with his knife a few
scales and cut a bit of the fish, but he could not eat it,
or the deepening swells sickened him, and he cast it
into the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is useless to follow Frank through the night. He
prayed with all his heart, feeling that no one but God
could come to his aid. He made solemn promises to
his Maker; at last he said that he would trust Him
whether he lived and was saved, or whether he died
alone in the boat. Frank meant to do just what he
had promised. The mist was drenching him now
more than ever; he tried to row, but his hands refused
to hold the oars and one oar fell from his grasp into
the sea. With a despairing clutch he tried to recover
it, but it floated off on the swell and he could not get
the boat around to the rescue; so it went off, as the
great world had done, with all its light and warmth
and food. Why, that pretty room of his own in the
house at Hallock Point seemed, as he thought of it,
like the loveliest place on earth, and oh! to hear Kate
say “Dear Bub!” once more, what joy that would be.
How Frank remembered the loving touch of his
mother, tucking him into bed long ago. Frank
seemed to remember every sweet and pleasant thing
that ever had happened to him, and with equal power
he recalled all his own bitter selfishness, and saw it,
for the very first time, in its true light.</p>

<p class='c009'>But how cold it was growing, and the billows were
heaving the little boat up and down in a helpless kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>of toss that was pitiful to think of. The second night
and nobody to find him!</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was too cold to care much more. He
shivered and cried again and tucked himself into a
little roll down in the boat, and soon grew to be unconscious
of all that was passing. All night the tiny boat
went up and down on the sea. At midnight the fog
lifted and the stars shone down, but Frank had suffered
too much to know it. At day-dawn a gale
began to blow and still the little cold bundle of boy
lay in the <i>Clover</i> and knew not that the day had come,
nor the gale, nor that a schooner had seen what was
supposed to be a boat adrift and was bearing down to
pick it up.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Frank knew anything more, he was lying
on a captain’s bed, in a captain’s cabin, with strange
faces looking on; and there was a cup of hot soup at
his lips, and somebody was urging him to “drink it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Very kindly, when Frank could tell his name and
home, the schooner <i>Blue Bell</i> put into harbor at New
Haven, to land him there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d better telegraph home, my boy, the instant
you get on shore,” said the Captain to him. “It
won’t be a moment too soon to relieve their minds.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose, Captain,” said Frank, thanking him
with a deal of boyish gratitude for having been so
good as to save him, and go ten miles out of his way
to land him—“I suppose, Captain, by the time you’ve
sailed home to Maine, you’ll find three or four reams
of paper done up into thanking letters, waiting
for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>“All right,” said the captain of the <i>Blue Bell</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank thought it would be so much nicer to witness
all the pleasure and surprise his appearance in the village
would occasion—to go right in on the first train
and meet everybody. Of course! What was the use
in sending a telegram? And then suddenly Frank
remembered how long the minutes must seem at
home; and the first real self-sacrifice that he was
conscious of for the good of others, was in hastening
with all speed to the nearest telegraph office, and sending
to his father this message:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m all right at New Haven.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Frank Hallock.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You may be certain that the young man who
received that message did not keep it many seconds
lying in the office. No; he didn’t even wait to write
it out, but appeared on the platform of the little station
with shining visage, and announced “Frank Hallock’s
all right in New Haven!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll carry it!” cried half a dozen volunteer messengers;
but while he hastened back to put it into
proper form, three lads started on a run for Hallock
Point.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a race as it was, to be sure! for everything
was clear and bright now, and a steam-tug had
steamed up at the town wharf, all ready to start, with
orders to cruise up and down until the boy was found;
and on board the tug were Mr. Hallock and Harry
Cornwall; and many a man interested in the recovery
of his neighbor’s lost boy was only too glad to lend
his presence and sympathy to the occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Flying went the six feet down the highway, reaching
the stone gateway leading into the grounds at the
very instant Kate Hallock and her mother, in the
phaeton, were putting Neptune to his utmost speed to
try and reach the wharf before the tug should start.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurrah!” cried three cloth caps—no, three boy
voices (the caps were taking a circle around the
heads and got a little mixed); but Kate, in her hurry,
could not stop and cried, “Take care!” as the nearest
lad almost pitched into Neptune’s fore feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop, stop! he’s all right!” fairly yelled the lads,
turning and running after the ladies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do they say?” gasped Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Neptune felt an awful pull at his mouth, and stood
still.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Frank’s found!” gasped one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Found!” groaned Mrs. Hallock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s to New Haven!” panted No. 2, dashing his
cap on his head, and thinking “They don’t act very
glad, after all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say he’s all right!” ejaculated No. 3, “and he’s
telegraphed it to say so. The man told us so and he’s
a-going to send it down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank’s alive and safe!” repeated Kate, bursting
into tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, boys! Come and see me this afternoon—will
you?” said Mrs. Hallock, and gathering
the lines in her hands, without waiting to hear their
answer, she drove rapidly on, anxious to spread the
glad tidings on board the tug.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never in all his life had Neptune been so urged
before to hurry over the well-known road to the town
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>wharf. He went flying down the hill and out upon
the wharf, Kate’s handkerchief waving as they went.
But what did it mean, that instead of the tug starting,
everybody on board was hurrying to get off? It
meant that the good news had arrived a moment
earlier. Neptune was duly turned around by the head
on the narrow landing-place, and permitted to pursue
his way more leisurely to the railroad station, to await
the arrival of the next train from New Haven.</p>

<p class='c009'>When it came up to the little station, a stranger
would have thought—well, there is no telling what he
would have thought; for the platform was solid with
men and boys, while here and there, amid the number,
peeped out a gladly tearful face of woman or little
girl. In the phaeton, behind the station, Mrs. Hallock
waited until, held by the grasp of his father’s hand
upon his arm, Frank came around to smile and kiss
and say how glad he was to be safe again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother, I think it’s done Frank good,” said Kate,
aware in some mysterious manner that a change had
come to her brother, even before he had told out the
half of his story of the fog, and the cold, and the
hunger, and the goodness of everybody on the <i>Blue
Bell</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>O, that was the true Thanksgiving Day at the house
on the Point. Mrs. Dobson was there for dinner, and
Harry Cornwall; and Josh Dobson was remembered,
for the part he acted, by all the turkey-bones a reasonable
dog could eat; and everybody was just as happy
as happy could be, and not one disagreeable word was
spoken by anybody from the moment Frank was found
until the last good night was said.</p>

<div class='c008'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_169.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
After a night of blissful rest in his own
bed at home, Frank wrote with absolute
good will to Mr. North, delivering over
to his ownership the <i>Clover</i>, then in care
of a boatman at Long Wharf, in New
Haven.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was a happy, contented hero for a
whole week, petted and noticed by whomsoever
he was met. At the end of that
time he went from this condition of affairs to be only
“the new boy from the country” in General Russell’s
school.</p>

<p class='c009'>We may not stay to give the history of Frank’s
school days, nor of the trials he there met. At Christmas
he was expected home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate subdued and endured her loneliness from day
to day, her chief relief from Frank’s absence being
found in writing to him long, loving letters, in which,
very soon, many lines began to be taken up with the
lovely times she was having at her drawing and painting
lessons. Kate began to feel the stir of a growing
affection for form and color. She scarcely understood
the feeling; she did not try to understand its
development; but she ran across the marsh bridge
with every bit of fresh achievement, whether of pencil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>or brush, to show the same to delighted Mrs. Dobson
and critical Harry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry was exceedingly industrious in those days—more
so than ever before. Harry had all the joy of
an old miser in his well-stored crops, and he knew just
when and where he could find sale for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a number of days Mr. Hallock had returned
from business bearing a brighter face, and Kate firmly
believed that the old, bothersome days of trouble were
passing away. Kate did not mind wearing last year’s
dresses one bit; and as for last winter’s hat and cloak,
the only day on which she sighed for better raiment
was the one on which she went to call upon Frank at
the school, and that sigh and wish were altogether on
Frank’s account; but when he whispered to her, as
she was leaving, “Kate, I say, I haven’t seen a girl
in New Haven half so good-looking as you are,” she
thought no more of old-fashioned hat or cloak, and
would have been willing to wear even the precious old
bonnet safely stored away in a big yellow bandbox in
the garret at the Point—the bonnet that had been worn
by her great-grandmother. Anything Kate would
have worn to call forth such a remark from Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>The evening of the day on which the first snow fell
that year, Kate drove Neptune to the station to meet
her father, and her brightest smile faded before his
sad, careworn face. She knew at a glance that some
new thing to worry him had happened; so, on the bit
of journey home, she tried her utmost to tell him of
every cheery crumb of news that she could think of,
and appeared not to notice any unusual thing about his
manner.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>That night Frank’s school-bill came. Mr. Hallock,
forgetful of Kate’s presence, looked at it and laid it
down with a long sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I see, papa?” was the first intimation he
received that she had heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Kate; and you may pay it, if you like,” he
replied, with a cheerless attempt at a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate looked at it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a lot of money!” she said. Presently, after
a minute’s thought, she asked: “Papa, have you got
the money to pay this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my child. At present I have not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would Neptune do it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neptune?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, yes. Don’t you remember asking me one day
if I would sell him? and I will, papa, if it is to somebody
who will treat him kindly and love him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kate, my dear, perhaps I may be compelled to take
your offer; but we will see about it; and if I do, you
shall have the finest pony—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, papa! don’t,” cried Kate. “I don’t want any
other pony, not as long as I live; it’s so dreadful to
love anything that can be bought and sold. I will try
never to do it again,” and Kate made excuse to leave
the room, fearing that she should spoil her offer by
crying. Kate had been a long time in coming to the
point of being willing to give Neptune up; but now
that she had made the sacrifice in so many words, she
was resolved not to cry about it—not if she could help
it; but feeling very greatly the need of more sympathy
than Neptune could give, and not wishing to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>known her grief to her mother, she carried her little
moan over to Mrs. Dobson; and finding her all alone
in the house, Kate had a good cry, and felt better by
the time Harry came in; so much better, indeed, that
she looked up, smiling at him, and said: “Neptune is
going some day before long. I’ve told papa he might
sell him; and please, I don’t want anybody to say they
are sorry for me, ’cause it isn’t myself that I’m sorry
for, but Neptune”; and Kate bit her lip to keep it
from quivering into another spasm of crying.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is going to buy Neptune?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The question came from Harry, who somehow did
not seem to feel half as much sympathy for Kate as
that young girl thought he ought to feel; and a bit
of indignation, more at him than at the talked-of sale,
escaped her lips in the words,</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, anybody who wants him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Kittie, my Clover, didn’t you tell me not ten
minutes ago that Neptune was to be sold only to somebody
who would be ever so kind to him?” questioned
Mrs. Dobson, with a bit of self-assertion quite unusual
in her manner, if not in her words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anybody could promise, but I should not be there
to see the kindness or the cruelty. O, I wonder what
makes God let men be so cruel! I pray and pray,
every time I see a horse whipped and jerked, and made
to carry too big a load, that some awful thing may
happen to the men who do it! O, I wouldn’t touch a
cent of money, not if I starved, that was made out of
the horse-railroads in New York—such dreadful,
dreadful loads as the poor things are made to carry,
and everything! I don’t think it is a bit worse—”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>But Kate did not finish; she was ready to cry.
Harry, foreseeing what would happen, took a letter
from his pocket and held it up before her face, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just see! What news!—from Michigan, too—from
one of the Huxtables!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Harry opened it and began to read, but the
heart of the letter he kept to himself, not feeling able
to have anyone bear it with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the night when Frank was out in the fog, Harry,
waiting in his room for the approach of low tide,
wrote the first letter he had sent back to his old home
since he had found a new one, and this was the
response, and this was the portion of the letter he had
kept to himself: “Last summer there was a real nice
man—ever so rich, folks say, whose name was Mr.
Ludlow, from Maine, out here looking for you. He
went everywhere, where anybody about here told him
you might have gone; and then when he couldn’t find
you anywhere, he put it in the papers, asking where
you were. We kept one awhile, but I can’t find it
now; but he told me he was your Uncle Horace; and
you must find him out, mother says, right off; and
there’s some land out here that belongs to you, that
Mr. Ludlow found out about, and he’s taking care of
it till you’re found.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now Harry had had a whole mile of a walk in
which to sober down, after hearing this great, good
news for himself; and he very quickly foresaw what
might come of it, not only to himself, but to his best
friends, and he resolved to keep it all to himself until
he could find out the best thing to do; and it was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>effect of this letter that Kate Hallock felt, although
she knew not of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m ever so glad you’ve heard from your friends,
Harry,” said Kate, preparing to go home; “and, for
my part, I don’t see why that queer uncle of yours up
or down in Maine isn’t looking you up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harry’s face grew very red—and Harry wasn’t
given to blushing. Had he stood where Kate’s quick
eyes had read more of the letter than he did? But
no; he had stood with the last of the sunlight coming
through the window on his letter and Kate was where
it was impossible to overlook it. Surely Kate had a
very curious manner of feeling things that she could
not see. He opened the door for her departure, and,
closing it after himself, he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me go across with you, Kittie. When the
snow and ice come, we can’t slip over the near way
any more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Over the stone wall they went, down the slope and
through the meadow, and they had even emerged
from the bit of woods before Harry found courage
to ask:</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you know of anybody who wants to buy
Neptune, Kittie, will you come right away and tell
me, because I know of a person who would like to
own him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is it? Anybody in this town?” quickly
questioned Kate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a reason why I can’t tell you who it is;
but if the time comes, you remember—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will, Harry,” promised Kate; and on the Point
side of the marsh they parted.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Before Christmas the snow came down for three
days in succession. It became doubtful whether or
not sufficient laurel, pine and hemlock could be
unsnowed from the forests and river hills to afford
the usual Christmas furnishings for the churches.
The marsh bridge was buried deep from sight, and one
vast gleam of white extended from the house on the
Point to the house in the Lane, broken only by the
bit of forest that lay between, whilst a round of snow
showed where the stone fences lay.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ice began to grow in the harbor and stretch
downward and outward into the bay. Every morning
more and more of the Sound was frozen over. It
was a cold, cold time, the coldest that had been known
in many years. Harry Cornwall was compelled to
assist Josh in bringing in the wood, for that industrious
dog could not fetch it fast enough to supply
the fires it became necessary to build to keep everything
from freezing up.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Lane, from Mrs. Dobson’s, seaward, had not
been broken, when, a few days before the twenty-fifth
of December, Neptune appeared, shaking his merrybells
adown the snowclad way. Not a dozen sleighs
had been before him since the snow fell. It was Kate
and her mother whom he was taking to pay Mrs.
Dobson a little visit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mamma, what if it shouldn’t be?” ejaculated Kate,
as they reached the house, adding immediately, “I
wonder that Harry didn’t hear us coming,” for Harry
did not appear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Kate,” added Mrs. Hallock, “I warn you
once more not to say anything to spoil it all.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“You may trust me, mamma,” returned Kate,
tossing the blanket over Neptune and carefully adjusting
it; “only I do so want it to be really and awfully
true.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To be very brief, the apparent object of this visit
was to invite Mrs. Dobson and Harry to spend Christmas
at the Point; the real object was to ask certain
questions regarding the young captain who went to
sea so many years ago. Not that he had been heard
from, but there had appeared a man, unearthed as it
were from an asylum for the insane, in a distant state,
about whom a number of persons had become curious
to learn more. After thirty years of insanity he had
begun to show signs of a restored intellect and claimed
to be—well, no less a person than <i>the</i> Captain Dobson
who was master of the <i>Snow</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The story he told was singularly deficient in dates
and details, but he was steadfast in his adherence to
the statement concerning his native state and town,
and remembered nothing between his life under a torrid
sun on an uninhabited island, whither he drifted
from his sinking ship, and his present state and condition.</p>

<p class='c009'>The state in question claimed from Connecticut the
money due for the support of one of her insane
citizens for thirty years, and investigation in this
matter led to Mr. Hallock’s learning the before-unheard-of
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not a word of all this must reach Mrs. Dobson,
although the old town was alive and bubbling over
with excitement on the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Mrs. Hallock had undertaken the mission to ask
Mrs. Dobson certain questions, but as the moment
drew close, she would gladly have relinquished the
task.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be real brave, mamma!” whispered Kate, the
second before the door was opened to admit them.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was Mrs. Dobson, in the sweetest of moods,
and snowiest of caps, making mince pies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m so glad you’ve come, ’cause I know Harry
don’t know how to go to your house to-day, and I just
wanted to know if you would not come to the old
house and take Christmas dinner with me this year,
you and Frank, and his friends, if they come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before Mrs. Hallock had time to thank her, or
decline her invitation, she went on to say, “This year
has been an amazing good year. I never felt so prosperous
and as if I wanted <i>to keep Thanksgiving all
the time</i> as I do now, and I believe I’ve fairly done
with the foolishness of looking out on every feast day
for the Captain. How he must pity me, if he is permitted
to look down and know how I’ve watched for
him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, grandma,” said Kate, rocking the blue chair
in which she sat until she made the floor creak, “what
kind of a man was it that you looked for when you did
look? He must be very brown, and dried, and kind
of grizzly by this time, living nobody knows where,
mustn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Dobson had taken her hands from the work
she was doing and sat down to talk to her guests. In
reply to Kate’s question, she said: “Kittie, I’m only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>waiting for you to get to be the great artist I know
you’re going to be, to get you to paint his picture
for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, I will!” exclaimed Kate. “But what will there
be about him that isn’t a bit like other men?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There will be two crowns upon the top of his head,
the hair of one must be black and the hair of the
other must be red,” replied Mrs. Dobson, “only I
don’t see exactly how you can make that show in a
portrait.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate suddenly ceased to work, bit her lip and tried
to avoid looking at her mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think we can manage it somehow,” said Kate.
“Perhaps we could paint him saying his prayers on
occasion of your marriage in the church.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We were not married in church; we were married
at home, and everybody stood straight up and Captain
Dobson was the tallest man in the room,” said Mrs.
Dobson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did they wear gloves then?” asked Mrs. Hallock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” returned Mrs. Dobson, “but Captain Dobson
never liked to wear gloves, because one little finger
was gone, and he said it made him feel as though he
didn’t know what to do with that glove finger
a-hanging.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It did not take a half dozen questions more—not
one of which seemed to arouse Mrs. Dobson’s
curiosity—to learn all that was desired. The description
of the man corresponded with the statement
Mrs. Dobson made, save that the black crown had
come to be white.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Mrs. Dobson,” said Mrs. Hallock, “our errand
here was to ask you to take Christmas dinner with us;
but this year, since you have been so kind, we will
come to you, only you must let me send down an
assistant with a few articles that I am sure you will
need, to accommodate so large a party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They left in haste. Neptune thought his little mistress
must be very cross—she snatched the blanket so
from his back; and he had been doing his best to
stand as still as he could! Straightway to a farmhouse
lying four miles from the village they went.
It was here that Isaac Dobson, only and younger
brother of Captain Dobson, lived; and to him they
delivered the photograph and the description that had
been sent, together with the story of their late visit to
Mrs. Dobson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It does seem, if true, a little more like a return
from the dead, than anything I ever heard tell of,”
said Mr. Isaac Dobson, who looked and appeared like
a man who was walking in a fog. “To think that I
may see my brother face to face again! Why, I was a
little mite of a chap the day he went away, and there
was such a crowd on the dock that I was lifted up to
see the ship sail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be sure, Mr. Dobson, that you get him home by
Christmas,” cried back Kate, after they had started
for home.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may trust me to do my best,” he said, and
immediately made preparations to go for his long-lost
brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the evidence given, it is quite needless to
assure the reader that this man was, indeed, the
Captain Dobson of this story.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>The happenings of Christmas day came in the following
manner:</p>

<p class='c009'>Very early in the morning, long before day-dawn,
Mrs. Dobson, on hospitable thoughts intent, was up
and doing.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as it was light, Harry, looking across at
the Point, saw the signal flying from the tower room
that he knew was placed for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something’s the matter over at the Point; I’m
wanted,” he said to Mrs. Dobson. “But I’ll not be
gone an instant more than I can help, and you needn’t
save any breakfast for me; I’ll keep my appetite for
the coming dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Kate who had signalled for Harry, on learning
the night before that in the morning a stranger
would come to look at Neptune. Very early she was
on the outlook for Harry. Frank had arrived late
the evening before, and in his uniform looked in some
way unusually brave and fine beside Harry in his
much-worn suit, that Kate had again and again
reminded him was getting a little too old for dress-up
wear; but Harry had only smiled an answer and kept
on wearing it. Kate would not have said one word
had she not been perfectly certain that Harry was
able to afford a new outfit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kittie tells me,” said Harry to Mr. Hallock, whom
he sought out, “that Neptune is to be sold, and I have
found a buyer for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is it?” asked Mr. Hallock, looking keenly at
the flushed lad.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not to tell,” returned Harry, “but you can
trust me—can’t you?—that it is someone who will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>very kind to the little horse. I hear that your price
is two hundred dollars, and I am authorized to pay the
sum to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somebody trusts you, my boy,” remarked Mr.
Hallock, “and so will I.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, sir. Will to-morrow do for the
money?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, Harry. You shall have Neptune,
though it goes very hard for Kate to part with him—very.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not half so hard, papa, just now,” chimed in Kate,
who had been lingering about in great excitement,
“when it’s Christmas and Captain Dobson—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kate!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate thrust both her hands over her mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papa, I think he ought to know,” she added
immediately, removing them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell him, then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Kate poured out the story in a manner as
refreshing as a summer shower, ending it with the
good news that papa had just received a telegram
from Mr. Isaac Dobson that “we will be home on the
midday train.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And grandma is going to church!” said Harry.
“I’m afraid somebody will tell her he’s coming.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a soul will dare to do it,” remarked Mrs. Hallock.
“I would carry the sad news of a death far
sooner than this dreadful joy to Mrs. Dobson. We
must just wait for the truth to discover itself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Grandma Dobson went that Christmas morning,
for Kate had the bliss of driving her to the church.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>During the service, Mrs. Dobson was pitifully disturbed.
Why was it that everybody seemed to regard
her with unusual notice? Was it because her bonnet
was “on one side”? No, that was not it; and she
passed her hands softly over the clustering curls—they
were all in place; and who was it, she wondered,
for whose safe return from a long absence thanks
were given. Who could it be? She hadn’t heard of
anybody’s return. She would ask when service was
over; but she did not ask, for everybody put the
thought of asking far away from her mind. She
never knew her townfolks so polite and kind before.
Everybody seemed so glad to stop and shake hands
and wish her a “Happy Christmas!” Some way she
told Kate, who rushed her home over the snow, that
she supposed folks thought she was getting too old
for a merry Christmas any longer; “But, Kittie, my
Clover,” she said, “I am not so very old after all,
only fifty-nine; and this Christmas, with you all at the
old brown house, will make me quite young again.
I do hope Harry has remembered to look into the brick
oven after the things I put in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t worry, grandma. Mother was going right
over and the cook, and I just this minute caught sight
of Frank hiding behind the corner. Go on, Nep.!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kate was intensely excited. Had Captain Dobson
got there already? Was he in waiting in the house?
and, O dear! how would everybody bear it? What
a dreadful thing too much joy was, after all!</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank advanced to assist Mrs. Dobson. The door
opened and Mr. Isaac Dobson came out.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“I thought,” he said, “you wouldn’t mind having
one more at your Christmas dinner to-day—or three
or four, for that matter; so I’ve brought my family
over; but we fetched along a roast turkey and some
other things with us—so don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m very glad to see you, Isaac. I wonder what
will happen next. This is a queer Christmas, I must
be allowed to say”; and as she alighted and glanced
backward up the Lane, she saw a dozen or more
sleighs approaching. Where could they be going?</p>

<p class='c009'>She hastened forward up the narrow walk, and had
not arrived at the door when the foremost sleigh drew
up by the side of Neptune, and she discovered old Dr.
Paul, minister of the First church, and close behind
him the rector of St. John’s with his smiling face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it a funeral?” she questioned; and then the
sweet, tired woman felt a little like crying, or laughing,
she did not know which; but Mrs. Hallock had
opened the door and said “Come right in. I want
to see you a minute before anybody else comes”; and
so Mrs. Dobson was led right into the room where
Harry was attended so lovingly in the early part of
this story, and Kate slipped in behind her; and so the
door was closed and the story told as only one sweet,
loving woman can tell life’s best story to another
woman as sweet and loving.</p>

<p class='c009'>The words that were said we cannot repeat, nor
even express the maze of emotion which filled the
heart of Mrs. Dobson—but she arose equal to even
that occasion, when Mrs. Hallock reminded her that
too great a shock might be disastrous to Captain Dobson,
who was like a little child in some things.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“Let him come in, alone,” she said, “and find me
here. To think that God has answered my prayer,
when I’ve been thinking it wicked to keep on praying
so long. Go, Kittie, and let him come in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Dobson was in the little bedroom opening
from the long kitchen, and from this room also Mrs.
Hallock knocked at the door. Captain Dobson opened
it, and silently that lady and Kate passed into the little
room and through it into the long kitchen, that was
half filled with sympathetic friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did she bear it?” asked one and another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as we might expect Mrs. Dobson to bear
everything,” Mrs. Hallock replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, without a word or warning, in her sweet
childish voice, Kate Hallock began to sing “Praise
God from whom all blessings flow.” She began alone,
but at the second word everybody in the room added
voice to voice, and at the close the door into the front
room was found standing ajar and Dr. Paul went in.
He gravely shook hands with Mrs. Dobson and the
Captain, and, after stating the fact that the first marriage
ceremony at which he officiated in his ministry
among them was that of Captain Dobson and Mrs.
Dobson, he said he would now, with the consent of
the parties, renew it. “It is too long for the silver-wedding
and too short for the golden-wedding, and,
my friends, we will call this the Praise God wedding.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without in the least intending form or ceremony,
Kate Hallock entered the room and stood beside
Grandma Dobson and Harry Cornwall found himself
very near Captain Dobson. The room was very full,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>as good Dr. Paul repeated the marriage service over
the bride with the silver curls and the man with the
calm, grave, happy face. “Not at all grizzly,” Kate
admitted.</p>

<hr class='c010'>

<p class='c009'>After that, hunger came down on all the multitude,
and so great was the care taken by Mrs. Hallock and
Mrs. Isaac Dobson, to say nothing of the contents of
the brick oven, that the minister and the rector and all
the friends who had come down to witness the dread
joy, thought not of Christmas dinner elsewhere
that day.</p>

<hr class='c010'>

<p class='c009'>You know already—you must know—that Harry
Cornwall had turned his farm-products into money in
order to buy Neptune, that he might have the happiness
of restoring that loved animal to Kate Hallock,
and that the plan was well carried out; and you ought
to know that you can never find in the Connecticut
Records that the charge for caring for Captain Dobson
so many years was ever borne by the state; but
you cannot know with what great reluctance we bid
Kate and Harry and Frank good-bye.</p>
